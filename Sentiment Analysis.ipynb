      "Positive :-> Very functional, easy set-up and great so be quality.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet for my daughter so far so good!\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought the tablet for work, but the only app we needed (free) never would download. After many tries and several hours, we gave up and took it back to the store.\n",
      "Positive :-> So far this tablet has been efficient. It kinda bad is difficult to use and it seems to require a lot of steps to get the kids profiles set up and it actually does not do everything I hoped it would.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet to replace a digit and one that was on recall. The Amazon ecosystem is nice and the tablet seems to work pretty well. I like the options for limiting screen time especially being able to get nature that reading goals are met FIRST. Unit needs more on board memory however. Make sure to buy an sd card to expand.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the sound quality and ease of use and setup. It's very informative and helpful\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good access to multiple venues. Cheap and easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought 3 of these for the family and it's been awesome.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this it was the best thing I brought My kids even love it and it easy for or them to use\n",
      "Positive :-> I find the Echo to be an amazing speaker enabled by saying \"Alexa\" to access all kinds of information and receive answers to many, many questions. It is constantly being upgraded with new capabilities and abilities.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this to replace the Samsung tab A 7\". That Samsung tab lagged a lot but I haven't seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab, the only downside is that the battery dies fast.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon adds are annoying. Lack of compatibility with Google and other apps is annoying. Price is great. Nice to have but it really isn't better than other tablets out there.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love everything about my new tablet. Good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails.\n",
      "Positive :-> We ordered the FireTV because it has an ethernet connection for quicker speeds. It also is 4K ready so when we get a 4K TV its ready to stream 4K content from youtube.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this to go along with the Vizio P65-C1 I bought. The Vizio is a great display, but with no internal tuner. It must be connected to cable or a streaming/casting source for programing, The Fire TV makes it easy to connect to Netflix and Hulu, among many other program sources. But, it's especially great if you're a Prime member, giving you access to Prime Video, both free and purchased. The only think I'd change is if it could receive HDR programs/movies. Amazon Video does have HDR programming available for a growing amount of its content, but this version of Fire TV does not. If you don't have a UHD TV, Fire TV is about perfect.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fast and easy to use. Downloading apps is convenient.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very nice tablet for the price and great for kids.\n",
      "Positive :-> Overall we enjoy our new Echo tower. The speaker is not the same quality as our Sonos or Bose speakers but the convenience of being able to ask Alexa to play a song or find a style of music or tell you the weather or traffic as you are running out the door make up for the quality. The kids love asking her to rap or tell a joke. I look forward to syncing Alexa to more of our IoT items to make controls \"hands free\".\n",
      "Positive :-> I have one of these tablets so it was a no-brainer when it came to purchasing one for a friend's birthday. This tablet is small and delivers a multitude of functions.\n",
      "Positive :-> Sometime it just stays in sleep mode and you have to restart it\n",
      "Positive :-> my four year old has trashed this one again. it really is great but I need to find ways to make it so the glass doesn't break. the computer itself is wonderful cracked like crazy and I cant cut my fingers.\n",
      "Positive :-> bought as a gift for Christmas. they love it!!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two one for my 5 year old and one for my grandmother. So easy to use, and they love it. Will buy more\n",
      "Positive :-> Did every thing we expected. I think it is like having someone to help you. It has the weather for any city I need it for. Plays the music I want to hear\n",
      "Positive :-> Having owned numerous streaming devices - Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, Fire TV stick and now Fire TV used on various TV sets in the house, I can say Fire TV is my favorite. The attractive interface and slick navigation, coupled with what I would consider excellent content, I truly enjoy my Fire TV the most. And future-proofed with 4K resolution just tops it off.\n",
      "Positive :-> A good product that provides the services I desire.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased two Amazon Fire pads for my kids. It has everything they need and you can't beat the price!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have owned a kindle before & prefer it to an ipad\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my niece and she really enjoyed it. She was able to watch Netflix on it and play games. She could surf the internet if she needed to. We went with the bigger GB since it wasn't much more.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like my stuff... was greatly delivered .. nice job....\n",
      "Positive :-> The lighting makes this kindle the best I 've seen.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle Paprrwjite is the best e-reader out there. Go for it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Truly changed the way that we live in our home. Ease of turning off lights. Getting answers to questions when Mom is too busy and listening to our favorite tunes. Not to mention the calling feature where you can call to another alexa that is at a friends or family members home etc.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Not the best tablet. Decent image, but lackluster performance.\n",
      "Positive :-> Paper white does everything I've wanted in a reader. Light, great lighted background, and the easiest to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works just as well as my Rokus, however the interface is completely awful. Buy the fire for kodi buy a roku for everything else.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this box specifically for Kodi, and Amazon prime, and I have not been disappointed! Super fast and no buffering! Love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Gave 3 out to kids for gifts, the kids love them. Will see how they hold up. They are not Ipads but for the price they are well worth it, right now\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a birthday present for my sister, and she had no trouble getting it set up for use. I was happy to find one with 16GB, not an inadequate 8GB. My other purpose in buying it was to test (on a cheap machine, just in case!) a procedure for installing Google's Play Store. That was a success, and I got a Fire HD 10 for myself.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product I love the back light on my kindle\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good entry tablet for toddlers. I like the Amazon exchange policy if it breaks.\n",
      "Positive :-> love it...works as expected. would recommend this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is great !!!! I would recommend this to family and friends\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this to remove cable, and the crazy high monthly bill. It works great, I don't miss a show, and save $75 a month! We'll worth it!\n",
      "Negative :-> Little disappointed in. Item very hard to turn off but it is easier to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought a FireStick because of the price. After purchasing the FireTv don't think I'll go back. Also if you buy this product sign up for your free Amazon Prime and checkout the movies and tv shows you get in HD and 4k..\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for reading and game play. Color is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves loves loves it!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for the price well built and worth every penny\n",
      "Positive :-> Best Buy makes it easy. No problems. I am a Best Buy Geek.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the speaker and the assistance of Alexa. Was trying to choose between this and a regular Bluetooth speaker and this was a better choice for my needs.\n",
      "Positive :-> I first saw the Echo at a friend's home. I bought one the next day on sale at Best Buy. This item not only plays any music I want to hear, but has many uses from locking my doors to controlling my home's temperature. Great item.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it's very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought one of these on Black Friday on impulse since it was $34.99 and I had a $5 certificate to use. I have a third generation iPad and am quite accustomed to using it and the App Store.Pros: OS is Android based and not too hard to pick up compared to Apple. I did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. It can take up to 128GB microSD card for expanding storage (only 8 GB built in). I got a 64 GB class 10 card at Costco for $20.Cons: screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but I can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. Not all apps available even if an Android version exists. Much more useful if you have Amazon Prime as it ties directly to an Amazon.com account, and In fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it. Battery life is not impressive either, with standby time in particular not great.For the price, it's a handy spare internet connected device. I'm not one to buy Kindle books, but the ones I do have are certainly easy to access and read.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price point for tablet, has front & back camera\n",
      "Positive :-> I will start with the disclaimer, I am not an Amazon Prime member. I have a feeling this tablet really roars around within the AP environment. Instead, I purchased it to watch YouTube videos, Netflix and Hulu shows, read a few digital books, and maybe other stuff down the road. Yes, there is an app for Hulu and Netflix and YouTube. But the Netflix app stopped seeing my memory card and a reinstall didn't fix it. This means I can't download videos to the 64 GB card I bought.I figured, I should be able to move files back and forth - but that doesn't work. No way to move the content to the card. So I have 64 GB unusable for Netflix and am stuck loading on the 8GB internal memory. When I take this thing on the road, I will have to rely on wifi to replenish titles along the way.The picture is good, though, bright enough and clear. Sound is just ok and I am disappointed by the top volume through both the speaker and the headphone jack - it barely cuts above the fans from my AC. I plan on adding a Bluetooth speaker at some point, but am guessing I will run into a similar issue - how to get more volume.At $50, I am plenty happy with the device, but it should use Android aps better. I know Amazon wants me on prime, but I should still get the best experience possible.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's great - each of my kids received one last month for Christmas (ages 8, 12, 15). We gave it to them mostly for reading and they love them. Yes the younger two game on them and watch their shows as well, but most of the time I \"catch\" them reading. I thought the ads would bug them but they only appear when you initially turn on the device and that's it. No one's said a thing. Good screen quality too. We purchased a 32g SD card for each tablet for more storage.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use to control my smart devices in the home and listen to music. my kids also use to help them with their home work.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product works great. It was very easy to. Setup and get an account going I would recommend the fire tv to everyone that wants to cut the cord from cable. It was cheaper to purchase it at Best Buy then it was on Amazon\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a GREAT small tablet. I love that you can increase the storage memory. It's easy to use and it is light, not heavy like some tablets.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for myself on Black Friday and am very pleased. For a FIFTY DOLLAR tablet, it has a great display and battery life. It's capabilities are below many system requirements of applications and games meaning they may not run at all or if they do, poorly. That's fine for my needs as apps/games aren't my focus. If you're buying a tablet for games/apps I would recommend looking past the Amazon tablets and over to full android os tablets or ipads as the google play and apple app store have muchhh more options. In that case, it definitely is worth it to spend more for tablet capabilities.I use my amazon fire 7\" tablet for reading, searching the internet, shopping from amazon, and watching movies from my sd card. It works great for my needs. The volume is fine and it does have bluetooth so I have my bluetooth ear buds connected to them most of the time. It's the perfect size and weight and does not feel 'budget.' Note: the invisible screens for this tablet are SUCH A PAIN to install and in my opinion not even worth it. If you want to protect the screen, I would recommend going with amazon's fire case it's very nice quality and the cover flap flips over to protect the screen when you're not using it.My point, if you know what you're getting and are ok with that, you're going to really appreciate this tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> This keyboard does it all for the beginner or for the professional. The keys have a real piano feel with some resistance. The speakers are amazing. The choice of instrument sounds are outstanding and the tone of those instruments are right on.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet for my 7yr old daughter for Christmas. I love that it's not overly complicated but not kiddy as well. Overall, awesome tablet for everyone.\n",
      "Neutral :-> This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this as a gift for my father and he has absolutely enjoyed having it!!! It was indeed a good purchase!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8\" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought as a gift for my mother in law for her birthday\n",
      "Positive :-> Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect!\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a great tablet we use it alot when we travel .\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice\n",
      "Positive :-> Not quite as easy to navigate as my old Kindle. If I press on a word to look it up sometimes I'm not able to return to where I was. Also, I have not had an instance where highlighting a character name and using x-Ray gives a description of the character; it only skips to references of the name that are contained in the book. In spite of these few shortcomings I think it's a great product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my watch bumper, but the tablet is so slow wouldn't recommend\n",
      "Positive :-> Great value. Easy to set up. Light weight nd very portable. Will provide hours of entertainment for my child.\n",
      "Positive :-> Overall sound is not as good as Echo, my primary source for Amazon content. However, the Tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock. It's portability sets it apart, however, it's nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting. Recent software update now allows listening mode. It does require a brief pause after saying Alexa wake word, but it does work. This drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button. The portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my Echo, which is fabulous!\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product. Noticeably faster than the fire stick. I use it with my Tablo DVR, SlingTV, and Kodi. With this there is nothing else you will need.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product. Zipper than the Fire Stick. Attractive design.\n",
      "Positive :-> This works great for my college class because it's small and compact plus it is very fast. I recommend it. It does what I need for school or just to play games, or enjoy the Amazon apps on the tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter love her new tablet, I use for a few days and it's pretty good\n",
      "Positive :-> Super easy to setup, I would even say you can cut cable tv if you put kodi on it. I have several thought the house and it never seems to be slow.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for 11 yr old Grandson. The look on his face made the money more than worth it. Kindle makes good products & I've been a long time Best Buy customer. never had a complaint.\n",
      "Positive :-> The fire tablet is awesome. I thoroughly enjoy the tablet. Everyone should have this item.\n",
      "Positive :-> Just picked up from BB a couple of hours ago. Screen in good and tablet seems faster than previous model possibly due to more memory. Battery so far seems very good.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use and A smoother interface than others like it\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is awesome point blank. It still needs improvement in the conversation AI in order to be able to have that extreme edge over the google home. But overall I love the home automation that is compatible with the product. Most importantly how well this behaves with vivint.\n",
      "Positive :-> So far satisfied with product. Have not checked into all capabilities\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this unit since it is compatible with 4K tvs and it is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could.\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo is great for playing music. You can stream most songs with a Prime membership. I want to set up lists and calendar and even control lights, etc. I just need some time to figure out how I would actually use those features.\n",
      "Positive :-> very easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> I chose this to check email and Facebook because I don't have a smartphone. It's a lot quicker than getting on my laptop. I use it for YouTube and Pandora also. My only complaint is my old eyes struggle with the smaller print. I am pleased with it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Had no problem with the instructions available in the system itself. Enjoy the 'easy on the eyes' lighting.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use grandson enjoys it .plus the two year warranty you can't beat kids can be rough on tablets.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this to replace a broken tablet hoping it would work for a replacement. Unless you are amazon everything. Google apps aren't easily installed on this tablet. Otherwise it's a great value for the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> Definitely the best streaming box in the market especially the new 4K version. I love this box better than Apple box.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for my dad who loves tech that his life easier the alexa integration is fantastic.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great streaming device so many options. I love Amazon Fire tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great!\n",
      "Positive :-> If you need to read a review about this product, you've been living in a cave.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a very fun and useful devise. Very easy to setup! It has great sound. I was able to setup with the apps to turn on/off my TV along with my lights. I love how there are so many new apps. I can't wait to connect it to my Sonos speakers.I love it so much I purchase several of the Amazon Dot for my family members for Christmas gifts.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an very good to use in all areas. The letters are very clear.\n",
      "Positive :-> This purchase was totally worth every penny I paid for it, which wasn't even so much.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the kindle to buy. Great resolution and a backlight is great. The higher end Kindle's don't justify the price difference. Use it all time time and love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 3 of these for my mom, MIL and 6 year old. All love it. You can not go wrong at all for the price. And it's very sturdy. Love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two of these for my children. They are not powerful, they do not have a bright screen, and the battery life is ok. But they are cheap options for kids to have tablets and helps keep down the fighting. App store is not good, but keeps kids entertained and that is why I bought these. Great value for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon tablet is great to have. Now I wish I bought more gb.\n",
      "Positive :-> Lightweight, bright screen, adequate capacity, great battery life. The perfect stand alone eReader.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle Voyage is easily the best e-reader with an impressive high-resolution display and it is very thin and light weight too. Loving it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchase this kindle fo your child and they will LOVE you! Seriously!\n",
      "Positive :-> This little android tablet does everything I want it to. And for the price, it can't be beat. 50$!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased the Echo for my wife as a birthday present from our kiddoes. Not only does she use it to add things to the grocery list, etc, the kids love asking all sorts of questions. Plus helps my son with his homework. Only drawback is if your playing music past level 8/10 sometimes it won't hear your wake up command. You'll have to press the wake up button on top. Overall we have all enjoyed it!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this Kindle. It is a replacement for one which was almost 5 years old when the built-in light stopped working. I used it constantly, for hours every day, carried it in my purse all the time, and traveled with it. I will not be without a Kindle. Replacing it was a foregone conclusion but I still read the reviews, just in case. :)\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product and only $40! I purchased 2 of them along with the compatible SanDisk 200gb micro SD cards to max out the storage capability. I was able to copy my child's stored tv shows & moves on to the sd cards from my PC's hard drive, now they can watch their shows on the go, it makes car trips a lot easier!  I also purchased Skullcandy Bluetooth headphones for each of them (got em' for $10 during Christmas). They paired with the Kindle in seconds, no trouble at all. + Kindle's customer support is awesome if you need them, their service is like no other...\n",
      "Positive :-> I had been doing research on wether to get an echo for a long time already had to take advantage of the sale.\n",
      "Positive :-> I hesitated initially when purchasing this tablet, mostly because I have never had a tablet or e-reader and wasn't sure I could figure out how to use it. Even though this table comes with virtually no instructions, there is a lot of information online and it is very intuitive, even for a total novice. Now, just about a month since my purchase, I am loving this tablet so much and am so happy I purchased it. The price break made it an even sweeter purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> Text is clear. Nice not to have the battery die every few days like a conventional tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought both the Amazon tv & the fire stick. I prefer this product cause it has a few extra perks such as 4K streaming, multi channel audio & hard wired connection to name a few.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good product. I recommend to anyone to buy it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect gift. My family love it! Have one in each of the rooms.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second Echo. The first one I purchased at Home Depot for 139. I knocked it off my nightstand a few times with no damage. The last time it fell, it completely died. So now it's just after Christmas and they are few and far between to purchase one. Amazon has a back order for almost a month for 179 and eBay tries to rape you with prices up to 300. I finally gave in and purchased one for 200. I love the Echo and all the accessories that you can purchase for it. BEWARE, buy a stand or wall mount for your Echo and protect your investment. My mistake the first time. If you have pets, you can count on it being knocked over. There are too many components inside the Echo to be abused. That is all.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this Amazon fire TV to reduce services from my cable TV provider. The unit itself is small and unobtrusive. As I already have an Amazon Prime account, setup and registration were simple and straightforward. The unit works as it should. It is fast and the voice search works better than I expected. I have only had the Fire TV for a few weeks, so I cannot speak to long term reliability. So far, absolutely no problems with the unit. Fire TV is a great addition for Amazon Prime subscribers.\n",
      "Positive :-> bought this for my father, who never did much on computers and was not sure he would actually use this. He unwrapped it, asked for some games to be downloaded and hasn't looked back! He has used the internet as well as the game apps and couldn't be happier.\n",
      "Positive :-> Its so small its easy to get lost under your TV! Its very fast, and easy to use. Log in to your amazon account and Netflix and Hulu and you have tons of options right at your fingertips!Have not really used alexa all that much so not sure how well it works overall. The phone app remote works pretty well so that is nice when you cant find the tiny fire TV remote/ too lazy to look for it! :) Some of the apps do not work all that great/ don't utilize surround sound but the main ones do. Got it on sale for $85. Definitely worth this price!\n",
      "Neutral :-> This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price\n",
      "Positive :-> i very like this item because is easy to use and fast conect\n",
      "Positive :-> Received this as a gift and is very useful. Battery power stays for atleast a week. Does not strain my ryes.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love all of the different apps that are available. I have a 12mpb internet speed and have not had any issues.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great. Sometimes voice recognition spotty especially depending on who is talking. Key is figuring out how to integrate it with what you need or else you forget to use it\n",
      "Positive :-> Much better than my previous ereader; Highly satisfied.\n",
      "Positive :-> I think this product works good. I would recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this stuff for myself to watch Netflix, YouTube\n",
      "Positive :-> If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Gave this to my mom and dad and they love it! Perfect!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this kindle paperwhite for my wife, she has a kindle and she likes to read at night, this paperwhite has a light so you can read anytime. She really loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a gift for my niece, she loves it very much!\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. I use it to read emails and watch Netflix\n",
      "Positive :-> the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs. It works well as promised.\n",
      "Positive :-> Absolutely can't get enough of my fire TV. Best purchase of 2017!! I highly recommend fire TV to anyone who doesn't want to pay a cable bill anymore. Hulu, Netflix, HBO is all u need and at about 1/10 the cost of cable, I love it!! Don't forget Kodi *wink*\n",
      "Positive :-> i'm an avid reader and love the Kindle Voyage. i love the adjustable fonts and that it automatically adjust to the light settings. The push sides to flip pages but not if you accidentally bump the wrong side which has happened a few times. Great battery life it's usually a couple of days before i have to recharge.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two of these tablets, one for my daughter's graduation and one for me. I like the size, the sound and picture/movie quality of it. It was a great price and the option to choose different colors were nice.. I didn't give it 5 stars for the simple fact I can't get all of my important apps that I used on my android tablet, ex. one of my credit unions, favorite news station and a few others. Other than that, not too bad for the price and other features I named previously.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a nice item but really there's other things that do the same thing. So we actually returned it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice tablet , does everything i need and easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had the Echo for several months and love it. The sound is excellent, the device recognizes my voice from across the room, and it's handy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I know not everyone wants to read a direct comparison to an Apple TV rather than a review on the moerits of this device, but I have owned both and stuck with the Apple TV instead of this.The Apps I used (DirecTV Now, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video) choked and buffered much more often, or froze completely. The wifi reception was also sub par.The remote is good, and I prefer the batteries approach to Apple's rechargeable one. Everything else though, the Apple TV seemed to do better.My two cents. Still a solid streaming device, and the price is better than Apple's. I would make the decision based on how plugged into Amazon's ecosystem you are vs. Apple's.\n",
      "Positive :-> Hard to figure out to use this tablet can't figure out how to close apps. Also says no storage to run wifi. Lastly bought three of them and one is not working wish it came with a user guide\n",
      "Positive :-> My previous tablets have been androids, so I don't care for the navigation on the home page. It has take some getting used to. However, it's nice to have an actual Kindle when I read my books, as opposed to just the app.\n",
      "Positive :-> Cant say enough good things about this product....we also have the fire sticks for other tvs.....This sure does beat paying for cable. It is very easy to set up and use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great personal assistant, calender works well , and you can message friends who have an Alexa. List for grocery store works well and sports updates are great\n",
      "Positive :-> The first kindle I purchased only worked for a week. Thankfully, Best Buy did a full return. This one works like a charm! My kids love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent TV box that brings you all the latest shows from Amazon and other venues..superfast with 4k\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Kindle Voyage, however it does not have a speaker for audio books. and changes settings ie. remaining time/pages left in book on it's own.\n",
      "Positive :-> Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my fire amazon tv box it's fast reliable and cool to have ,I would highly recommend getting one\n",
      "Positive :-> ......................................................\n",
      "Positive :-> Best reader i think for the price. The only thing amazon needs to work on is the user experience. Make it a little easier to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my first e-reader. The screen has a nice feel to it. It reads really well. I don't like the fact that Amazon has total control of your purchases. I do not like the Amazon free unlimited book trial. They don't allow access to certain titles. So far I am able to find most of my book selections. I will be creating my own reading lists and want zero input from Amazon. The battery life seams to be awesome. Of course when you shut it off ads pop up. The kindle claims that it doesn't take up battery to display these ads. But they seem to mysteriously change on their own (even when it is turned off) Strange. It is super nice that you can read in the dark with this one. (Kindle Paperwhite) I like the fact it is small enough to carry around in a purse, yet big enough to read...the font is adjustable too, if you need bigger letters.\n",
      "Positive :-> I visited a friend who had one and I was sold immediately. I love how all your streaming needs are in one little box. Plus it works with Alexa. I intend to get Alexa real soon..\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this at Best Buy since I had a $10 reward coupon so only sent $40 for this tablet. Short story this tablet can do everything your smart phone can do and I kinda like Amazon's new OS running on this tablet better than Android, nice clean interface and very user friendly also like the way categories are on top and you can swipe right to view them. As far as speed is concern this tablet is good, you can jump from apps with ease (although installing new apps are a bit slower than on Android) the apps have installed are Facebook,Linkedin, Overdrive, CNN, Pandora, Pinterest, Skpe all run fine. You can even run games on this $50 device, games like Sky Force, Real Racing 3 (these game have high graphics) run surprisingly smooth. Videos on Netflix, HBO Now, Pluto Tv and Youtube look great even though they are not HD. Sound is just ok (my smartphone sounds better) and the display is good compared to other cheap tablets on the market that are not IPS. Battery life is good too, can go a couple of days without charging with just reading books, checking Facebook, surf the web and gaming. Already accidentally dropped my tablet on the floor with no damage at all.I not a Prime Member but purchase a lot from Amazon so this device is convenient when ordering books and other items. This tablet has been rock solid for the week I have it and it's still shocking to me regarding the price with no compromise in quality. Was going to buy the Amazon Fire HD but since my last $270 Amazon tablet was lost this makes more sense since it's at a price point where you can easily replace it. Amazon has really changed the game with this tablet, other's reviews that state that this is only for kids or beginner tablet owner's I disagree with. Now for the people who must have the best tablet on the market (looking at you Apple Ipad and Samsung) then this is not for you, but for others who need a device to do everyday task (just like your smartphone) then this is the one don't let the cheap price fool you.\n",
      "Negative :-> Poor response. Very sluggish. Even the Amazon app is slow. Not so on my Apple or Droid tablets. I've yet to load any apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my wife who swore she would never give up paperback books. Now she uses this one all the time. It's the perfect size to fit in her purse for trips too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for a Beginner tablet bought this for my mother for Christmas and she loves it. Plays all the android games on it and runs no problem.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for my 89 year old mom. She has enjoyed reading on it. Easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> So cool & easy to use. It was easy to connect & sounds really good.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's easy to carry and super device for all books.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this product. Will not go back to satellite or cable.\n",
      "Positive :-> Really like this pretty easy to set up I love the bumper also the free time settings when time is up that's that and no figthing with mom. I thought I saw something stating that the free time feature is only free for one year so rating may change if I find this to be true. Would hate to be charged for what the kindle was intended for.\n",
      "Positive :-> My husband loves it! He has been reading since he got it for Christmas.\n",
      "Positive :-> Unit is fun. Combined with speaker to stream sirius xm.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Echo that I received for Christmas from my wife that I bought it for my son in law for his birthday. He has Amazon prime so he can do much more with the Echo. I will be subscribing also.\n",
      "Positive :-> After reading both positive and negative reviews, took the plunge because it was on sale and wanted 4k.Had a little difficulty setting up/ scrolling the onscreen keyboard/ inputing passwords because the remote didn't work properly out of the box...after the system updated the firmware, no more problems. After moving the unit to another house, wasn't dfficult setting up on that network.Some reviewers said that the menu is too Amazon-centric. Does have a lot, but no problem downloading and using other streaming services (Crackle, YouTube, etc)4K: limited content, but quality seems okay on a 50\" 4k tv. Need a fast connection.Has an app- it could be better.If you don't need 4k, and have an iDevice house, Apple's box would be a more compatible choice...\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves this tablet. I love how you can regulate the time spent on this and control what your kids do on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> It was nice to have an extensive library at my fingertips.\n",
      "Positive :-> my grandson really loves it, is reading a lot of books already.\n",
      "Positive :-> I would like to say that they are really tuff the hold up to my kids lol\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazons fire tab is amazing entry level tab. just go for it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is much better than the echo. The sound is great\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to take on vacation and I love it! I use it to read ebooks, watch Netflix, check my email. Definitely gets the job done.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the paper while kindle. I can read at night without a table light on.\n",
      "Positive :-> I wanted to buy the kids edition but it cost a little more, so I decided to go with this one and it turns out to be exactly what I need. I am not sure but I think the only difference is the rubber case.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very pleased with this purchase. I no longer need cable tv service since I purchased this. Easy to set up. Simple remote control.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it on black friday sale. Use it as a ODB reader for car and reading books every once in a while, for $35 there's nothing wrong with it\n",
      "Neutral :-> Navigating around the tablet can be somewhat confusing at times, but for the price you cannot get a better tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased for a 5 year old. Perfect for kids and as a first tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Echo is a wonderful piece of technology. I recommend it for anyone from tech expert to novice.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great sounds great! Bought this for a gift and was more than impressed. Stereo system is really good .,follows Alexa commands or\n",
      "Positive :-> I thought this for my 8 year old and she loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Cheap device running Amazon's OS. No problems installing apps or using the device. Highly recommend for $49.99 (or $33.33 during Black Friday).\n",
      "Positive :-> I can say it does recognize every accent, but there were too many questions unanswered.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a gift for my wife who in the past said she would never use a Kindle. Since getting one, she uses it any spare moment that she has. It is convenient to take on trips, easy to use, and can be read in low lit areas. The antiglare screen is great when used outdoors or in brightly lit locations.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's light and it holds a lot of my books! I carry mine always in my purse.\n",
      "Positive :-> User friendly and overall great product. Camera quality is not the greatest but this is not intended to be used as a camera so I can't complain.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great features and easy to use. A must buy for Prime members.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is very fun and helpfull. I do wish she could search and understand better. You have to ask questions the correct way. But still fun for kids and helpful around the house for shopping and music.\n",
      "Positive :-> Price is affordable but Display pix is very less compared other products in the market for the same price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Plan to buy a second a second Amazon Kindle for a hi e year old.\n",
      "Positive :-> Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got it for my daughter for christmas. She's very happy with it. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. It could have been 5 stars but the camera quality is not that great. But for the price I got it for it's good enough.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the Fire box! Saves us tons on TV. Love all the Apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> Take out the box from packaging, connect box, turn on the box and watch Amazing Amazon tv just like that.....any easier and easier or convenient it can not get. Great buy at Best But.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got it during black Friday weekend at a great price, works good no problems with them.\n",
      "Positive :-> We love to go to the beach and the wife loves to read when we are lounging around. Great graphics, even in the direct sunlight. Simple to download books and the battery life is very good\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two kindles for my children and they love them. They are easy to navigate for all of them .\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up and easy to use! And the speaker sounds amazing.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice tablet for the price. Just wish it had bluetooth.\n",
      "Positive :-> this was great buy & can do it all.fair price & great games\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is fast, expendable and cheap! It runs the Android OS, which houses most of the games and apps you'll find on any Android phone. My only complaints with this tablet are the screen and cameras. The screen becomes washed out at a 45 degree angle or more and the cameras are unusable due to the noise they produce. Otherwise, this is a really great product!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for the money. I got it on black friday and am so glad I did get a few of them for the entire family. The biggest thing that sold me on this is that I am able to use parental controls and not worry about what my little kids are watching, reading, or playing. Go buy it for the family, you won't regret it!\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this Kindle so that students I work with could use Bloxels. This is an app that goes with a physical board that allows children to create their own video games. The Kindle is certainly sufficient for the task, and has stood up to about 50 early elementary aged students use!\n",
      "Positive :-> I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable.\n",
      "Positive :-> This device is great for the home. It plays thousands of songs, provides current news, answers all sorts of questions. Great for my kids to get answers on any subject.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up, Amazon gives lots of help and new ideas for using it! Fun and very helpful!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this on cyber Monday and it was worth it. Alexa is my new best friend.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my mother for mother's day, and so far, she absolutely loves it. It's fast, great resolution, and I've yet to hear of any battery issues from her. I picked this one for the reasons I just listed in addition to the access to Amazon Underground (FREE APPS that normally cost with Googly Play & Apple Stores, respectively).For those reasons, in addition to the price, you can't go wrong.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> These are all true and they really are up on your reading or browse the Web with this tablet, which offers access to Amazon Underground, so you can download apps and games and discover exciting new entertainment. Front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments, love love love.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton!\n",
      "Positive :-> I would recommend this tablet to everyone that wants a tablet. It is real easy to play games, Facebook and google.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great and inexpensive tablet which meets all my needs and expectations.\n",
      "Positive :-> We enjoy asking questions, listening to music. Need to learn more of the things that it can do. Great voice recognition.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have 2 of these one for each one of my kids I love it for kids the instead of buying something so expensive I chose this and the geek squad protection is awesome my son cracked the screen and they where just amazing and replaced it with a brand new one\n",
      "Positive :-> Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased 3 of these and I loved them, until I tried a Samsung tablet. I rather have a Samsung vs the Amazon fire, but they are great for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Best Buy had them on sale so it was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them \"echolettes\" LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Echo is my new BFF! I use it right now primarily for my shopping list. I say \" Alexa, put eggs on my shopping list.\" And Alexa says back \"I've added eggs to your shopping list.\" Then when I get to the grocery store, I open the app on my phone and there is my shopping list! No more forgetting what I needed to buy. I'm looking forward to learning more things that Alexa can do! I have played my Pandora music on the Echo, asked Alexa to tell me a joke, and checked the weather. She can do so much more.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this gadget. Plays music, makes grocery list, tells me the weather reports\n",
      "Positive :-> Very convenient, easy to use, excellent quality. Love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> My Fire is easy to use, lightweight, and small enough to carry in my purse.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great step up from the ATV which I had 3\n",
      "Neutral :-> Not happy at first as battery was totally dead when I got it. However, after charging, it's working ok\n",
      "Positive :->  \n",
      "Positive :-> cheap - need to constantly make sure plugged in - slightly too small - saved some bucks there - not amazon quality\n",
      "Positive :-> These were ordered one for 4 year old and then ordered second one for 2 year old. They are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Fire HD is easy to use. The 8\" tablet is just the right size.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great with Amazon Prime Music. Very impressive speech recognition. (On the other hand, Amazon Prime Video Streaming is not Included in Apple TV or Roku apps.)\n",
      "Positive :-> It's the amazon version of AppleTv. I guess I expected something a little more \"wow\" for the cost, but it looks like amazon's app on my xbox and smart tv. Not anything super special. It works as intended though and not really any problems. The remote feels flimsy compared to the aluminum of the apple tv gen 1-3\n",
      "Positive :-> Had to chose between Fire 10 and Fire 8. For the money, you can't go wrong with the Fire 8. Screen is good for \" older eyes\".\n",
      "Positive :-> There are a lot of questions that were not answered. I just like the fact that I don't have to get up and turn off the lights.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Kindle is great. Customer service rep for technical questions---not so much.\n",
      "Neutral :-> I bought this expecting the same quality i have received in the previous 3 kindles I purchased. I am disappointed. I like the price. The home screen is just all the apps right in your face, not just the ones you want, like in the older version kindle fire. I mostly use it for reading books, and so far I'm dissatisfied. It's great to swipe to the next page, but when I want to go to settings or something else while reading I find it difficult to open. Instead the page just turns and by the time I finally get to the book settings, I've lost my spot! I downloaded the Facebook app and it's very slow. Maybe it's Amazons way of telling me that's what I get for $50 but come on. Sometimes I like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow. I compared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed. I know there are other cool user tools, but for me I mostly use it to read and check Facebook and maybe Pinterest. It's priced well if you want it for kids, it's user friendly and my kids have already figured out all the options. I would recommend it for kids or for people who are technologically not savvy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for a Christmas Gift and they love all the things it does. No complaints yet\n",
      "Positive :-> Still learning with her. Speakers are outstanding and footprint on kitchen counter is small. Like it a lot.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Best Android Based Set-Top Box For it's Price.Amazon outdid themselves here with their Fire TV line. They got it right and they do not appear to be abandoning this anytime soon so hop on now while it's still hot.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought four of these for my kids and they love them\n",
      "Positive :-> Netflix app runs great no buffering and good HD quality. Amazon app and movies have their issues. But overall I like my fire tv. If only Amazon ran like Netflix then would be 5 stars.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy enough for my 3 yr old to use, great deal!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle paperwhite is a great asset for all kinds of readers at an affordable price! Lightweight and easy to throw in your purse, backpack, etc. no glare in the sun\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazing tablet, does everything I need it for and upgrade tricks to make it even better. I like this tablet and all I can do with it...watch my shows, stream music, browse the internet and read my favorite books and comics.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for traveling on a plane. Use this item for games newspaper and listening to music.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well enough but is outstanding for the price, just be wary of the operating system you could poetically download an android emulator that would make this a 4/5 instantly\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased 3 of these as Christmas gifts for my grandchildren to play games on. Excellent tablet for the price!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased as a gift, perfect for small children! Easy to use especially for children's apps with the touch screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Fire TV is very easy to setup works faster than Fire Stick because of a Ethernet connection.\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It's very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won't regret the investment. It's so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product.\n",
      "Positive :-> ok I have played three games it's great, have had no time to do other work yet\n",
      "Positive :-> We received one as a gift for Christmas love it so much we bought one for our parents.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was a little confused at first but with continued use it worked really well. I enjoy taking photos of my adventures.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for my kid. Great price great performance\n",
      "Positive :-> These box is amazing!!! A must if you have Amazon Prime.\n",
      "Positive :-> Gave as a gift.Did not know you had to \"tap\" it before you talk. Thought it was like echo.Anyway, they still love it and does not mind pushing the button to talk.Really likes that it is battery powered, portable.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon products are always great products! This time, the pricing was very competitive and reasonable.\n",
      "Positive :-> I prefered reading actual books over reading digitally, because the screen made my eyes hurt. However, the kindle paperwhite isn't designed like a regular digital reader, it so different. I could read it for hours and my eyes won't hurt.\n",
      "Positive :-> My review is not a review of the device as much as my opinion on which product to choose when trying to decide between this and Google home.Google home is the closest competition in this landscape and its still lacking in comparison to Alexa.All of the interesting features of Google home are non existent or slowly being released. Using these features as a selling point is disingenuous.More than that Google home constantly has trouble detecting my voice and doing any of the assistant commands. In the same environment the echo dot with budget hardware had better success rate. When it did detect it the time to action was x2 as long as Google home is much more \"chatty\".\n",
      "Positive :-> I'am having a lot of fun with the Amozon echo there is so much to learn i get email letting me know what she has learned and up dates The sound was really amazing for something so small\n",
      "Positive :-> If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet that can keep up with everyday casual use then this tablet is a good buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy set up, tons of music, easy to use. If you are looking for voice activated, this is not it.\n",
      "Positive :-> My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I'm in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice easy to navigate and simple enough that my grandkids can learn. Also can set limits on use very important\n",
      "Positive :-> I just love this toy, with time she will get better\n",
      "Positive :-> Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for reading at nightLight is perfect on the screen\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use and well lit for night reading. Charges fast. Light weight. Love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet to read books online and I love it the screen is nice.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was using a Kindle Paperwhite and when I saw this on sale for black Friday, I figure why not. I have been very pleased so far.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet for my sister and she loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is just the right size and price for my kids. For just playing the games, watching netflix, or just cruising the net, this is a great value.\n",
      "Positive :-> We have enjoyed Alexa. She will play songs for us, give us information, and even tell jokes.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second Fire TV box, and it's a great upgrade from the first gen model I had. The buffer time is lightning quick, faster than my Roku. The 4K works well, and the Amazon ecosystem is actually more complete than what the Apple TV offers. Very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for the money.This does all and more than some for a great value.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my new Kindle Paperwhite! Love the lighted pages and the ability to change print sizes.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet, especially if you're a Prime Member. Only drawback is the ads.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this Kindle as a Christmas gift for a friend. Couldn't pass up the Black Friday price on this thing! Works great. She loves it. Success!\n",
      "Positive :-> Very pleased with the Fire TV. I thoroughly researched alternative products before deciding on the Fire TV. The unit is fast and I enjoy the integration with Amazon Video, Netflix and other streaming services. My only issue is that the box is very simplistic cosmetically as compared with Apple TV or G Box. Other than that this is a great product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price for the product you receive. Great way to cut cable bill.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great device is you are to read a lot of text.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it. Good size for travel. Great features. No glare when using outside in the sun.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the tablet. It is pretty awesome. Easy to use and you can download lots of free games that you couldn't download for free on other devices and underground Amazon is the reason why.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love Alexa. Cannot wait to set up smart home and fully utilize all that Alexa has to offer. The Amazon music feature is a wonderful bargain!\n",
      "Positive :-> Sleak littoe device for the price for normal everyday use.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a reader, wanted to get the cheeper one but you were out of stock. this one works well\n",
      "Positive :-> Would completely recommend this product offers everything we were looking for in a movie box system\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my first electronic reading device. I was one of those people saying I like the paper book in my hands. However the convenience, especially when traveling, is an understatement.\n",
      "Positive :-> For the fundamentals of tablet use this one works great!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a really great upgrade from the regular Kindle, however, it's not such an appealing product after Amazon updated the base Kindle to the same hi-resolution screen. May be worth waiting to see if Amazon upgrade the Voyage over the coming months.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my 2nd Alexa in the house. Love the speaker on the bigger one. the Dot speaker is pretty lousy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Must have!!! Movies, sports, and much more at the click of a button (you must have wifi to use)\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire TV has a lot of content, especially if you are a Prime member. Apps are easy to install and use\n",
      "Positive :-> I got the Amazon Echo and the Dot to supplement it. Although they say that the Echo can hear from all over, it really can't. It depends how far you are and how loud the surroundings are (ie. television or stereo on or even if the Echo is playing loud music itself). So, I got the Dot for my bedroom and it works just fine.It's a little complicated to setup to the wifi but once I figured it out (I needed to turn off the automated wifi connection on my smartphone), it worked like a charm. After the Echo is connected to the wifi, you can turn the automatic wifi back onto your phone. I'm just getting started to using it with my Smart Home automation. So far, I can turn on/off & dim my lights in my living room with just my voice. Love it...!!! Once I get more bulbs for my bedroom and hallway, I'll add those too. It just gets expensive at $29.99 - $49.99 per bulb!!!Also, I wish you could re-name/call it something other than Alexa, Amazon or Echo. Nothing personal but it doesn't make sense since there's a box to enter the \"name\". So for now, \"she's\" Alexa.\n",
      "Positive :-> This FireTV is amazing in the way it can turn any tv into a smart tv. It is quick and responsive. We only using it for its streaming capabilities but so much more can be done with it. We also own a Firestick and they both seem the same for performance. So if you only plan on using its streaming capabilities you might want to look into the cheaper firestick.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well, kids love testing it and \"adding\" items to the grocery list.\n",
      "Positive :-> The recharging port is not working consistently. I have tried other cables, so I know it's not the cable. Otherwise it works fine. I am looking forward to not having to charge it but once a week.\n",
      "Positive :-> We got this tablet for my aunt so she could read, check emails, and play games. It is very easy to setup and use for anyone!\n",
      "Positive :-> Work perfectly for as a small tablet for checking Facebook and playting games. The screen is so much larger than the phone for easier viewing. It's nice that it can take pictures, but the quality is not up to most phones.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids loved it, they were able to learn how to use it right away\n",
      "Positive :-> Now the best memory for facts in the household without ever being smug about it. Sometimes she doesn't know the answer and that makes her even more appealing.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product and fun to use. We find new ways to use our Echo everyday.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased two of these tablets for Christmas presents (10 yr old and 7 yr old children). Had researched them prior to buying so new what they were capable of and what they weren't. Pleasantly surprised with overall performance and durability. No, they are not iPads, didn't expect them to be, but at a sixth of the cost they do their job extremely well.\n",
      "Positive :-> I wish echo could play music (at the same time with the same song)to other dots in the house\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the color pink for granddaughter she loves carrying around her own tablet. Wonderful product. love the safety protective case great unit.\n",
      "Positive :-> Maybe it's because their older or have had other tablets, but this was the easiest setup ever!\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought this for my daughter.. She love it too much.. And it's the best tablet for the price..\n",
      "Positive :-> Great beginner tablet for all ages. Easy to use by all ages.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have two boys, 5 and 7, they empty the tablet's battery everyday playing, still working perfect.And parental control is very good.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the fire box! Quick and easy to navigate. I watch all my faves in the apps and cut the chord with my cable company!\n",
      "Positive :-> Fast processor, excellent interface. You need this if you are cutting the cord.\n",
      "Positive :-> amazon fire tv is on fire... this is the best stream device now in day.i will highly recommended. the speed is amazing. all you need is a good internet service to enjoy it's maximum potential.and if you have a prime account in amazon you get to enjoy many movies and tv series. get this device for your home\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire tv is the best \"smart tv box\" available. The box is now 4K video capable and uses the android operating system. Plenty of apps already installed and tons more available. Setup was simple and the menus are a breeze to navigate, especially with voice search.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my nephew, He loves it I have also got them for my mom and myself. they are fabulous, the price is so low.. you can really do a lot with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This review is more of a guide for cablecutters, which we have found fire TV a great way to accomplish this. There's plenty of reviews explaining how to use the fire, so this is more for people like us who don't want to pay full cable prices but are ok with paying for access to apps to still watch all our cable shows, at a significant savings to cable, and are used to using a dvr (we used tivo) and don't want to watch commercials. We've had this box for a couple weeks now, and while it has taken some getting used to, since you have to access your shows through individual apps instead of them all being on one big list, we have found it worthwhile to make the switch.Keep in mind you have to be able to plug an hdmi cord into your tv. We actually had to buy a new tv to be able to use this box but tvs are so cheap nowadays that it was still cheaper to buy a new one than to keep up with our cable bill. The savings in just the first several of months covered the cost of the tv. The interface on the fire tv is really easy to use and navigate through all the apps you wish to use and everything is kept nice and organized. We got the box instead of the stick because we wanted to have a more reliable, faster wired connection to our internet. At first I was sad to read on other reviews that the voice control doesn't work on any of the apps, but honestly I've never even used it once since getting it and once you sign into everything, there's not much need of typing to find your shows on other apps so I really don't miss it at all. If you just want this to watch prime tv included in your amazon subscription then you can stop here, the rest is about what apps we use (and pay for) to watch our shows. I will list what apps we have found useful and what we found we could do without.Read more\n",

      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire TV is real easy to setup and use......\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books.\n",
      "Positive :-> Three of my children have 1 of these tablets each and really love it. Don't like that it doesn't have google chrome or PLAY store but a solid tablet for a great price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets.\n",
      "Positive :-> Working Product at the price that was advertised! Great!\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon fire was a gift for my mom and she seems to really enjoy it. I have one so I bought her this one for her birthday. She enjoying all the games she downloaded.\n",

      "Positive :-> This tablet is a great value for the price point. Great functionality and value.\n",
      "Positive :-> After using the amazon fire tv for about two months, I can say that this is an excellent streaming device. I connected the fire TV to through the Yamaha receiver to my TV, therefore I get a perfect 5.1 sound. Amazon service is acceptable except the fact that they kind of force you to buy different subscriptions or buy movies if you want to watch the new stuff on the market. But here is the good news, you can use the device even without an amazon subscription - with Netflix, PBS, and so many other downloadable applications. With an 128 GB USB flash drive formatted in FAT32, this device may become an ideal player connected to your TV\n",
      "Positive :-> Fire TV changed my life! This unit is awesome. I absolutely love it.\n",

      "Positive :-> I love that I can talk to it and get an answerI have recommended to my sister. now we can send a message to each\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet and the size is perfect for kids. Amazon also offers unlimited kid activities, for a small price of course.\n",
      "Positive :-> This version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before. Very happy with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great but needs more work to be worth the money. Very limited in what can be asked in a form of questions. You have to continually down load skills in order to ask questions related to topics this is very taxing and spending time doing it makes you just say, \"forget it\". Hopefully this will be fixed soon. Really should have purchased the Google one but oh well.....\n",
      "Positive :-> I started with the dot and I'm glad I upgraded the sound quality is way better she hears me when I Call her name It's a big difference\n",
      "Positive :-> Clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. Long battery life.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Echo for my son and daughter-in-law and they loved it. After Christmas I decided to get one for me and the wife. I really didn't think I would like it, but it turned out to be my favorite new tech toy. I already had a Honeywell smart thermostat and quite a few WEMO light switches. Now instead of getting out my iPhone to turn on the light, or change the thermostat, I just say \"Alexa, turn the bedroom lights on\" or \"Alexa, turn the thermostat to 74 degrees\". Best tech toy of the year!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an amazing device for $50 . Nothing more to say!\n",
      "Positive :-> The back light is a great addition to this kindle, along with the page press! It's perfect for only using one hand to read. I would highly recommend this kindle and is worth the extra money.\n",
      "Positive :-> I highly recommend this product. My previous kindle didn't have one, so I'm very please with this charger. It's much more convenient than recharging through my computer.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect size reader, no fuss, websurfing, videos, netflix, hulu, no problem\n",
      "Positive :-> We have this and the echo. We love them. My grandchildren have fun asking questions\n",
      "Positive :-> I know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the \"official\" cover. The origami cover is ugly and I was skeptical, but I actually love it. It's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. This actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. It's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the Voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. The origami part of the case works great as well... it stands vertically or horizontally (if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing).\n",
      "Positive :-> This device destroyed the competition with Google home side by side, so now I have virtually my entire apt connected via Alexa.Such an awesome investment.\n",
      "Positive :-> Our 3 year old grandson loves asking Alexa to sing songs that he learns in pre-school.\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves his new tablet. He goes on it as soon as he gets home from school.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the size, the portability, the reading options, the organization options, the look of the pages, and the price. You can't go wrong with the Kindle PaparWhite!\n",
      "Positive :-> Its a good tablet, screen is kind of weird but it does its job. I wish the it had more memory but for the price, I can't expect to much for a inexpensive tablet. But what I do love is that all the apps are free so that's a #SCORE. Great for kids\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a great device to have. It does so many things. Very practical.\n",
      "Positive :-> My family has enjoyed the amazon echo..it gives us the opportunity to listen to different types of music . My family loves sports and they like asking Alexa questions about sports .\n",
      "Positive :-> Wish you could choose the response name of your own instead of the ones provided\n",
      "Positive :-> Wall charger is convenient. Just wish it was sold with the kindle instead of having to purchase it separate. Seems like it should be standard in the package. Had to purchase in a bundle in order to get it included with kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> What a great price and very easy to use.Had a little trouble getting past my secured connection though.\n",
      "Positive :-> Our first Kindle finally gave up the ghost after many years of use. Love this new Paperwhite. The front lit screen is great as my old Kindle required a case with a light in order to read in the dark.\n",
      "Positive :-> I just like reading amd playing games on it..Better then those bulky computers\n",
      "Positive :-> I had an older Kindle but it got a virus. The only thing I have against this one is that it gets very hot. Best Buy did not carry covers for it.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is very convenient while working out, traveling and stuff. The mic is at the right location and it is good to answer calls as well. I have connected it to my iPhone and use it to listen to music and take calls. The best part is even if you don't want to plug it in your ears, you can leave it hanging around your neck!\n",
      "Positive :-> It was bought for 11-year-old she seems to like it we will see\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use. Great size. Great price. Easy to navigate.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it's lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle's battery.Read more\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought two of these tablets for my stepson and mother-in-law for Christmas. Not bad items for the price. Basic tablets,basic features, nothing special about them. They use them for connecting to the internet, playing games and watching movies. This tablet does this well on wi-fi. I expect them to perform well for the next couple of months.\n",
      "Positive :-> its great\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my mother in law and she hasn't had any issues with it. Runs her games and internet browser fine.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really didn't expect it to be so convenient. Carrying just the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite instead of multiple books.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second kindle fire I have purchased for myself and a family member. Great tablet, easy to use, light weight and a great price.\n",
      "Positive :-> This kindle fire 5th generation 7inches is a very good product.it works well.and best buy customer service was so helpful.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my step sons. They positively love it and it is so easy to navigate. The only draw back is with the capability for them to download games the memory is close to full\n",
      "Positive :-> The adults and children who received the tablet as a gift have thoroughly enjoyed it.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is a great little portable speaker with many uses.\n",

      "Positive :-> This device is very easy to use and it's also fast and so many movies to choose from! I would highly recommend this to anyone!\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had an iPad and iPHone for years, which also allow me to read my kindle library, but the Paperwhite has three advantages: 1) you can see it in bright sunlight, 2) the charge will last for weeks, and 3) because it is much cheaper it is less vulnerable to theft and less of a loss if it is damaged. I bought the Internet version, but it is also available with a connection to the kindle net, which enables you to download books anywhere, even where there is no access to Internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am in love with the Alexa Tap. This is a great portable speaker and now that the added function of being able to talk to it without manually pushing the button sets this apart from the rest. I would recommend to all.\n",

      "Positive :-> This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage.\n",
      "Positive :-> While I purchased this item as a gift for my son, it proved to be one of the best choices I could have made. He loves Alexa and the ability to ask her whatever seems to be on his mind. Echo is a wonderful complement to information availability and information technology to better our lives. A great gift and a most useful item.\n",
      "Positive :-> This item was purchased for seniors to keep them up to date with what is on the internet without the expense of a laptop. they love it and the ease of operation,.\n",

      "Positive :-> The product works great as of now. It arrived as promised\n",
      "Neutral :-> I've never had a tablet other than an apple. It seems to charge quite slow but I'm not sure if it's because of the tablet or the cord or some setting I'm not aware of; but it charges ridiculously slow, other than that I am very happy since it's for my son.\n",
      "Positive :-> Santa brought this to our daughter, she's 7 and it's perfect for her!! Easy to use and figure out!\n",

Wi-Fi great so you can download book almost anywhere.Comfort of a real book with technology to assist with purchases. Best combination !\n",

      "Positive :-> The price was right for what I needed and it dose what I need it to do.\n",
      "Positive :-> Originally I bought the stick. I ended up giving the stick to my friend because I had bought this as a present for my brother and helped him set it up. It is extremely fast so I bought one for myself. The fire tv is fantastic for watching anything\n",
      "Neutral :-> It is an ok product. But the main reason for the purchase was because it was for a first time tablet owner. It is very cheap in price but without a google play store it kind of sucks. But like it says it is ok for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Incredible value for the price! And it's the perfect size. Try one out at Best Buy and you'll see what I mean!\n",

Love it :)\n",

      "Positive :-> I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update.\n",
      "Positive :-> At first I was a bit skeptical about the sensitivity of the touch screen on these new kindles, but it has been great. The reading is very smooth and I am quite please with this purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased two Fires that were on sale. The quality, speed and display can't be beat for less than $50 by any other company. And having the ability to expand it's capacity with a Micro usb card is definitley a plus.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my son so he could use it with Alexa. It's great\n",
      "Positive :-> excellent for kids and safe cover so if dropped it survives\n",

I am enjoying many different programs that my cable does not have.\n",
      "Positive :-> The fire meets my needs for my reading enjoyment. It is less cumbersome than always carrying around a book. I have no problems whether in daylight or at night. I would highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> My husband, kids and I have enjoy Alexa very much. Having her play music without us lifting a finger is my daughter's favorite feature.\n",

      "Positive :-> Sound production is outstanding!! Very easy to set up and use!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my parents fur Christmas. They live them. Very simple and easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> Would prefer hardware buttons and wish you could access public library digital book. Other than that works great in the dark.\n",

      "Positive :-> Great deal. The downfall to this device is that you have to pay an extra $15 to get the ads removed from your lock screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had purchased a tablet for my son as s Christmas gift and he loved it, he let me use it and I loved it, especially since I have problems with my hands. This tablet proved to be the best thing for me. My experience with Best Buy is the best choice I could make on my tablet. The staff is fantastic, they helped me to get the basics down pat, you can add me to your list of return consumers.\n",
      "Positive :-> A great product for the price, performs bigger than what you would expect. The memory expansion elevates this tablet to allow for multiple content and apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to \"tap\" the speaker to get it to listen.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazing that Amazon beats Apple at the voice recognition game. Great product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Hopefully works great this is for my 3t son. Can't beat the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> For the price. You can't go wrong. If you're looking for something basic and don't want to spend a lot of money. Here's your tablet. Good for kids that will pretty much will ruin you're expensive ipad or something.\n",

      "Positive :-> Great product. Excellent for small business, kids etc. Good on the go.\n",
      "Positive :-> The amazon echo is great. She knows and understands majority of commands. I haven't used that much, but from what I have seen... so far so good. Got it on sale xmas season!\n",
      "Positive :-> I now have two of these boxes. They are better than Apple roku and other boxes for Internet tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet could use a better speaker otherwise a great tablet\n",

      "Positive :-> Great for kids or anything to do with simple task. Great to for watching Netflix,YouTube or just checking email. Love play games on it from the app store. The family loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a giftt for my wife. She uses it mainly as a method of reading books and loves it. The memory is more than sufficient for normal usage and is expandable if needed. The fact that it is not HD does not matter to her but if you use it to watch a lot of movies, you might want to spend the extra $100 bucks and get the HD. JShe does watch Netflix on it but usually watches movies on our big screen television. Great buy for the money. She loves hers\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet is a good tablet not the best for games or apps but decent especially for the price\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great for checking the weather, checking your calendar, playing music and asking questions.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for my elderly mom. Compact, but easily readable.\n",

      "Positive :-> Enjoy the performance and size of the television we purchased. We are very satisfied with this product\n",
      "Positive :-> Better than I expected in performance very reposnsive\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price and value. Fast processing. Many games and user options available.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had trouble deciding between the regular kindle and the Paperwhite because I read at night. It was a great decision, because when I turn the light all the way down, I can't read at night. It's lightweight and sturdy. My only complaint is the speed of switching between books and the strange flicker with the page turn. It's not a show stopper, because it is so much better than trying to read on my iPad mini.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great gifts for grandchildren.. At the per unit price, I'm grandpa of the year.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Kindle Paperwhite. I can read at night without my eyes bothering me. The builtIn light is an awesome feature. The screen looks just like the pages of a book.\n",

      "Positive :-> When I first opened the box, I was unsure as to my feelings about this new Kindle. BUT, after learning to use it, the performance has been first rate. The variable brightness makes it easy on the eyes to read day or night.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this awesome gadget to use it with my 4 k tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not a great display for watching movies! Reading books on here is very cool\n",
      "Positive :-> This is amazing for helping you keep track of stuff. Also fun to just talk to Alexa.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet. Love reading my books, playing puzzles, and going on basic social apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works very well, even after the novelty wore off we have found it entertaining and useful,\n",

It felt kind of a headache some times, but with the Fire tv n more and the picture look great!\n",
      "Positive :-> The product is cheaper than the kid version but works the same. It is a great product from Amazon. The camera is so so but entertaining the kids are great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the capabilities it has to offer.Downside, it totally shuts off by itself and you have to start what you doing all over again\n",
      "Positive :-> Very nice gadget for Kindle users. The 7\" display is apt for reading\n",

      "Positive :-> This unit is a must have in your smart home setup. I got this unit because I was very unhappy with my Google Home that I purchased prior. Alexa has a whole lot more smart home integration than Google Home and is very easy to set up it controls my lights and other devices in my smart home, and I was able to implement it with very little effort. I would definitely recommend this product it is a great sounding speaker as well for your home if you would like to connect your phone and stream things like Pandora. Also it is great to have in the kitchen it does conversions from cups to quarts Etc, you just ask it the question and it gives you the answer it's very easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> kindle Paperwhite is easy to use, lightweight, and perfect for the avid reader. It easily allows you to take book(s) with you wherever you go since it's so small, thin, and light. The battery lasts for SO long, it's easy to find where you left off by using bookmark, definitions are a press away, easy to read in the dark (a book-light is not necessary!), and stores an enormous amount of books on one device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good bang for your buck, as far as a tablet goes, works well camping\n",
      "Positive :-> This product needs a bit more info to explain how it works and the set up. It is all quite easy once we had a neighbor over to help and ro explain. We are still exploring how this works for us but so far it is almost too good to be true -- especially with the price!We are hooked on 'the night manager'\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this box. It's the best thing out there. I cut my cable completely off. Great savings.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is super quick, alot faster than 2014 version. Alot better video quality imo\n",

      "Positive :-> I bough this for my daughter and it's perfect for her little tiny hands, I just wish that the screen would lock when she is watching her shows because she gets excited and touches the screen and it pauses or chances the show or it goes to other apps. Overall it's a great product for a small child\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this thing. I had one of the original ones before I got this one and I love that one. So when I got this it blew me away. So many new functions still so reliable. And now I can read in the dark. Amazing.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. It's a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. Handles all apps and HD content well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my wife and I think she was able to use it maybe a week before our kid stole it. He loves the thing.\n",
      "Positive :-> very good tablet .i like it. but regulation is little low.\n",
      "Positive :-> Never knew I needed a tablet until I got my hands on this one\n",

      "Positive :-> I would recommend it. It is fun to use and puts out good sound.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought one of the first Macs in the 80s. I've had 'too many to count since then.' I am an early adopter, by nature. This has been true of Amazon's Kindle product as well having owned the First Generation Kindle, K2, K3 and now the K Touch. Love the reader. And I love this case as well. I hear all of these complaints that this leather case looks cheap or doesn't have a closure, or it's too slippery. PLEASE. I find it to be a PERFECT fit for the Kindle Touch. The unit snaps in a la DoDo Case -- which is such a great product for iPad. Very similar design only on a much smaller scale, obviously. The leather is not an issue for me. I do NOT find it to be too slippery at all unless, perhaps, your hands are covered in oil This is a first class cover for a first class e-reader. And NO. I do not work for Amazon. I'm just a HUGE Kindle fan.\n",
      "Positive :-> I LOVE my Paperwhite Kindle. The convenience of this product speaks for itself. I can read and purchase books anywhere, anytime.When my husband bought me my first Kindle 9-10 years ago, I opened it up and wasn't too sure I was going to like it. Boy was I wrong! I will never go back to books. Best product ever, well worth the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> Still learning all the things it can do but solo it is a nice quick answer system and music player. I now have mine hooked to HUE lights, Honeywell Thermostat, and a Belkin outlet with a heater. Nice to have Alexa turn on my kitchen lights when I'm running in groceries.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my sister as a gift. So far so good. The price was just right.\n",
      "Positive :-> ECHO (ALEXA) is a nice bluetooth/wifi speaker that is portable and can give you information when you ask it questions.Can Sync with your phone via using the Amazon Alexa app.Speak it in the AIR\n",
      "Positive :-> Will not stay connected to WiFi. When it is connected, device has to be within 6-8 ft. of router. Need this in the kitchen. Don't want to walk 25+ feet to use it. My other wifi devices work everywhere in the house as well as most of yard and garden. So I don't get it. Sick of looking at it - useless.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have 'Alexa' in the living room. Each morning I ask her the weather forecast and plan my day. If I need to go out I ask her the traffic conditions. While watching television I can always get inside information on shows as well as the actors and actresses. While playing cards with friends and family 'Alexa always finds the right background music for us. This is a great product!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Negative :-> We returned this item after 2 weeks. It took a lot of repeated request to get it to listen to us and it just wasn't as easy to use as I thought it would be.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is the start of a very long relationship. I'm able to order on Echo, listen to music, and have a joke told to me.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome product! Backlit, shows you page number & easier to turn pages.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a gift for my friend. I personally own 1 Alexa and 3 echo dots. This product is excellent, easy set up and easy to use. I would recommend this product over google home for one Alexa was the first to come out with this and a lot of tweeks and updates are posted in the email. I have my kitchen lights hooked up to Alexa and can use by dimming out my lights. Hope you will enjoy your Alexa as well as I did mine.\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely LOVE my new Kindle! I'll never run out of good books to read again! Best Buy had it delivered 3 days before I even expected it to arrive. Couldn't be happier\n",
      "Positive :-> Too\n",
      "Positive :-> This has the all speed and storage I needed for my first grader. The case is soft and light and I can tell it will protect the tablet really well. I really like the ease of getting to the kid-friendly apps and videos. Has easy to set up parental controls.\n",
      "Positive :-> Overall am very happy with the purchase. Both Quality and price made this hard to resist.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is great! Wish I had more instructions on what she can do\n",

      "Positive :-> The echo has provided idea many hours of great music ,laughter and info.\n",
      "Positive :-> Hard to beat for the price. Great for browsing, movies, web.\n",
      "Positive :-> Debated between firetv and Apple TV and ultimately went with firetv due to price. Works great, easy set up and easy navigation. I have not had any buffering issues.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was hesitant to upgrade from my original firestick to this, but I'm glad I did. It works much faster and smoother. Well worth the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong!\n",
      "Positive :-> My son enjoys to play with his tablet but definitely you gotta take a little time to set it up for them to be safe while they are playing with.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent price, app store could be better but mainly using this for PBS Kids app for our son and Netflix when mobile.\n",
      "Positive :-> This thing is amazing. The possibilities are endless.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was looking for just the right e reader for my wife\"s birthday. She loves to read in bed before she falls a sleep and her old one did not light up so she would struggle to try and read in the dark and use whatever little beam of light she could to be able to read while I slept and with this one it is not even a problem any more the screen lights up and she can easily read while I am sound a sleep.\n",
      "Positive :-> This next to the fire stick I must say have been the best pusrchases ive made to date. This takes over your cable and you can cancel your cable right away. Even more when you get kodi on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> For starters i had the Amazon stick for a while & got tired of that due to all the buffering issues, but what can you expect out of that little stick? so when this went on sale, i decided to upgrade & i'am so happy i did, it works great & has reduced the buffering to a minimum, but like anything online depends on the site your on. Love the fact you can speak into the remote and pull up the site you want.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for the cook or germ aphobic in your life...hands free...very fun and handy..awesome music\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn't meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great as a digital assistant--music, grocery lists, etc. But Alexa is no Google, that's for sure. For my uses, it's just fine. Supposedly, Alexa keeps getting \"smarter\" so this should improve, but it's not there yet.\n",
      "Positive :-> picked this item up on Halloween nite. Great content and shows-will recommend to friends and family\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for teenage tablet, perfect for homework!!\n",
      "Positive :-> This a great item for kids to learn how to use electronics.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my Amazon echo. Works with my Wemo lights and nest thermostat. She also plays prime music.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Kindle Paper White for travel, its so much lighter than bulky books and can fit in your hand luggage/pocket to read while travelling. So easy to use no screen glare like tablets have so you can read it anywhere. Has adjustable screen brightness and font size too.Has the technology to allow you to order and download books from anywhere you happen to be. I love it so much I bought my sister one too!\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this when I cut cable since at the time it was the only device that had a Sony Playstation Vue App. Although Roku added this channel almost immediately after I purchased the Fire TV, the user interface for Vue is better on the Fire TV. Roku has more apps / channels. However, Fire TV is still a decent compliment and the 4K capability makes this a viable option. Speed and performance is good.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have a couple of these along with a couple of firesticks. Works good with the Kodi App\n",
      "Positive :-> Its is a great product.Fast and reliable.Streaming and services are the best\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my kindle, i did a lot of research and this was the best option for me, i don't regret buying it.\n",

      "Positive :-> Definitely the best buy for your buck. I have too of them both hard wired and no buffering ever. Love my Fire TV's.\n",
      "Positive :-> Happy yes, but all the advertisements are annoying. We knew they would always be there. It is what it is! We are iPad users and it is a step down from the iPad.\n",
      "Positive :-> Recognizes any voice including our grandkids, no training required. Much faster than surfing the net for info, amazon provides great capability, can't wait to add gadgets.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice little tablet does what o want it to do will definitely buy again\n",
      "Positive :-> LOVE BEING ABLE TO MAKE SPECIFIC PROFILES FOR MY CHILDREN\n",
      "Positive :-> Had some remodeling performed in the house. Had to move the echo to another location. After the job was finished, moved it back and just needed one in both locations.\n",
      "Positive :-> I loved it. Not only was the price good, but 8gb of memory is phenomenal!\n"

      "Positive :-> I bought this for my niece for Christmas. I must say it is fast and comes with Amazon underground apps which are all free. Great value!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchase this tablet for my brother who is handicapped. Mostly so you can watch videos off of YouTube. Pretty easy for him to understand how to use a tablet. Quality of the screen and speakers are pretty decent. Really good value for how much it costs.\n",
      "Positive :-> Its a steal at 33.33$. I bought the second version of Kindle fire 3 years ago. And its still running great, even with respect to battery life. I have gifted everyone in my relation. Bought around 10 of them for gifting.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this one for our white kitchen. Blends in well and is very handy both in the morning and at dinner time. New features added weekly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent. Grandchildren love them. They were so excited to receive this and have not put it down since. Even my 2 year old is having a ball\n",
      "Positive :-> Speakers sound real low Not easy to use at allHave to pay for everything\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet on thanksgiving day when I was already in the store buying a new cell phone. It was on sale $59. I am very pleased with my purchase. I am already an Amazon prime member so it links up to my account. I am very happy with my purchase and recommended to my brother who bought the same day I did:)\n",
      "Positive :-> Generally Alexa is spot on when asked a question. Whether it's the weather, the time, my upcoming calendar events or most music. However, when asked to play classic oldies, I will usually get old country music. When asked about an actor in a tv series, she doesn't know the answer, even though I can find the answer on google. My grand kids love it for the corny jokes they get.\n",
      "Positive :-> Had the Echo Dot and it was time to upgrade. The sound on the Echo is fantastic. I use it to check weather, wake me in the morning, control my Philips Hue lights, Nest thermostat, and of course, listen to music :-)\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this item and have not been able to put the remote down. A great product that I would recommend for anyone, works well with my 4K TV\n",
      "Positive :-> This thing works great. I highly recommend it. Good price on sale.\n",

      "Positive :-> This is my son's 1st smart phone and so far, it does what he needs it to do.\n",
      "Positive :-> With so many program choices available with Amazon Fire Stick, why would you want cable? Cable is just too expensive. This is a much cheaper alternative to cable.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was well received. A wonderful upgrade from a first gen Kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought 3 of these for gifts. I am in love with Alexa. She learns new things daily and is easy to understand.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like how cheap this is. It's great for browsing the Internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> While there is absolutely nothing wrong with this item, the kids get more fun from it than I do. It is extremely impressive with its prompt responses and info.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Seems less finnicky than the Chromecast (sorry, the *GoogleCast*) in a lot of ways... though I learned how picky it is about resolution when I tried hooking it up to a stand-alone monitor. It didn't care for that so much.\n",
      "Positive :-> We have spotty radio reception so going through the internet is ideal. I could have done the same thing with a speaker for about the same price. However this is more versatile as I can send messages to others and make lists plus more features are being added all the time!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my toddler to watch his shows on netflix amazon and vudu. Vudu isnt compatable, netflix is so slow it kept buffering, so he got upset. Acording to its specs it has a faster processing system than my linsay tablet bit its five times slower atleast. Downloading anything takes forever. It was also very difficult to navigate.Over all waste of money\n",
      "Positive :-> After about 2 months of use, I can say that my wife and i are very happy with our purchase. The Amazon Paperwhite kindle is exactly what we wanted for ... reading literature. We tried to many times to duplicate the effect with a tablet but found the shiny glare to be too much. The paperwhite is easy on the eyes, and easy to use. I did give it 4 stars instead of 5, because after purchasing I learned there is slightly more expensive version (like $20 more) that doesn't include the frequent ads were where having to deal with. Luckily we were able to find out how to pay Amazon an extra $20 to eliminate the ads, but it would have been nice to not have to deal with it at all. I would recommend anyone looking at this product get the version for $20 more and eliminate the annoyance of the ads.\n",
      "Positive :-> Is a great first tablet for a beginner or children\n",
      "Positive :-> I have several Fire tv boxes and they all very good for streaming Amazon, Netflix and others. If you have a 4k tv this box will delight you with the ability to stream 4k content.Great buy!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product very easy to use. Installed kodi on it and love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my kindle. Good idea to save some space around the house . The size is great for my bad eyes .\n",
      "Positive :-> Gotta say, I love this silly thing! Total light show, PLUS so much more!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love Alexa! Sure she is just my play thing but, much to my surprise, she has been more useful and efficient than I thought she would be. The Alexa app coupled with Alexa herself and I can keep my day organized, informed, and on track. I'm thinking about buying one for upstairs as well....\n",
      "Positive :-> When back light is off it's just like a paper. Very convenient for reading. For night, back light is so well done that still look natural.\n",
      "Positive :-> my gesr fit heart monitor was not compatible with android level\n",
      "Positive :-> If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!\n",
      "Positive :-> Works very well. It is perfect for my brother whom it was bought for\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love the parental controls on this device. You can even set a time limit on how long they can use it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games\n",
      "Positive :-> my brother still doesn't have a smart phone. i bought this device as an introduction to him to the Apple world. he loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I wanted to upgrade my Kindle Fire - First Edition. This one is really nice. Graphics are superb as is the speed in loading. I don't know, yet, what else it can do as I haven't explored it thoroughly. It's like a mini lap top and has a camera that takes very clear pictures and has wireless connection to the internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome speaker and home automation control. Very recommended.\n",
      "Positive :-> Like all the features and voice recognition is very good. Although the product was setup for Berlin weather which makes me think this was a returned device and resold.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is very light and convenient. i often use it in the evening.\n",
      "Positive :-> Did a good bit of research for the fire tv. Bought the stick first, had several operating issues. Unit would buffer then freeze up. The unit got real hot. Returned the stick for the fire tv box. Have not had any of the same problems. Saving over $100 a month cutting out cable. So paid for itself, definitely a great decision.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my kids. Perfect size (physical and storage) for them. Privacy settings allow for plenty of checks and balances against their purchases.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not the fastest for loading web pages, but apps run smoothly. I've noticed that internet connection will not function if there is not enough room in memory, so delete some apps if you cannot access wi-fi. Great for Netflix, Flixter and games. Good resolution, just short of HD, but can tell the difference if HD is chosen over SD when given the choice while watching movies.\n",
      "Positive :-> Was using the Kindle app on my phone and running the battery down and dealing with glare. Paperwhite resolves both these issues. Not a real bookbetter.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet. I bought several for gifts. Best Buy had the best price. I only gave four stars because of all the ads preloaded to these tablets is a pain.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have two smart TV's. I use Fire TV more because it streams better and more reliably than the TV's.\n",
      "Positive :-> I can control both upstairs and downstairs nest thermostats,play music,set a timer and so much more by just saying Alexia. I would recommend it to anyone!\n",
      "Positive :-> This thing is pretty awesome. It's lighter and thinner than my previous one. I am a fan.\n",
      "Positive :-> I can read, even in the dark. I can surf the internet, Facebook, pay bills, play games. It was inexpensive and I love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon FireTV is a great product. I buy a bunch of them for friends and family because they are the way of the future for streaming devices.\n",
      "Positive :-> I now have 5 Amazon Echo Units. Can't get enough of them. GREAT...!\n",
      "Positive :-> Smooth operating system. It's no IPAD but good enough for the money. Purchased for the kids to eliminate abuse to our higher priced items. Would have no problems buying the item again at this point.\n",
      "Positive :-> Had to take first one back because the screen went haywire. The second one is doing great. Love how much it holds.\n",
      "Positive :-> My granddaughter loves it. It was a perfect gift for her long airplane trip.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a gift for my mom and couldn't be more pleased at how she is enjoying it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I just brought 4 and NO I has had success pairing the device. Amazon doesn't have any tech assistance and the directions are for a remote but w-o a smart TV, I don't think you can get much from the device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price! Got it for my kid for Christmas. He loves it! He plays games on it and streams Netflix with ease!\n",
      "Positive :-> Have had some fun with it but it really is not very smart and sometimes just plain wrong. Did you know that all of Florida is in the Eastern Time Zone? And here I thought I lived it the Central Time Zone. Alexa does get the time right though and can share some good information and does ok with music. You just need to ask the right questions in the form she understands and then she does ok.\n",
      "Positive :-> I gave this as a gift to my sister and she loves it. The battery life is great. She recently took it to a trip to Canada from Texas and her battery lasted all trip!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet was perfect for our kids. The easy to you features made it ideal for all ages.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had the Firestick and recently upgraded to the Fire TV. Wow what an improvement over the Firestick. Well worth the slight up charge for the improved performance.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very happy that I decided to upgrade to the paperwhite version of the Kindle. Now I can see what I am reading. It was very difficult with the original Kindle that I received as a gift.\n",
      "Positive :-> I picked up 3 units for Christmas gifts for my kids they loved them.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughters love this tablet and all they can do.\n",
      "Positive :-> My son's already each had one. Got one for my husband. Great value, and all are reading more than they ever did.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for my elderly mom to play games and use for reading\n",
      "Positive :-> Love everything about the unit except that it gets hot when used for 10 to 15 minutes. Hope it doesn't burn or explode.\n",
      "Positive :-> I plugged it in and helps tremendously with the kids homework as well as let me change the light in my house hands free. Also has a great speaker so I can hear it clearly across the room\n",
      "Positive :-> I love how easy the Kindle is to operate. It is very intuitive, and requires only a short learning curve. Also it is one of the most economical ways to read books.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's affordable, great for kids, it's very good.:)\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time!\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids get kind of lost when they use this product. It does have everything but is not as user-friendly as I hoped it would be.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's great to read either in the day or at night. It's light and has nice feeling of touch. My friends bought their kindle long time ago, and I just got mine. The design and everything is better and better. I love kindle paperwhite than the basic one. I would highly recommend it to my other friends if they don't have one.\n",
      "Positive :-> Like to ask questions to Alexa without have to move from my chair. Really like the skills that relate to what I like and what I need.\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love my echo because I am lazy to log on my computer to ask google. Also I get multi use of it as my personal Pandora music box. The only downside to this is Alexa can't hear you if your room is big because of echoing in the background....also I forgot her name once and had to walk next to her to turn her off. Other than that...I love her!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for searching and opening multiple apps at once.\n",
      "Positive :-> Just what I needed. Perfect\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for streaming movies and tv shows that aren't offered on regular cable\n",
      "Positive :-> Like to have in house. It makes life easier and no need to browse internet\n",
      "Positive :-> The product is very light, making it easy to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not much need for this thing, good price, but makes one wonder if they were on sale because they really don't do much and it would make a good gift for a youngster just getting started with a tablet. Not impressed at all.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really like this product. Work well. I don't need cable anymore.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love EVERYTHING about our tablets. We haven't put them done since purchasing them.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one.\n",
      "Positive :-> A good enough tablet with great features and very decent screen quality.\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablets are easy for setting up, & using. Thank you.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the Kindle Paperwhite!! It allows you to read in any type of situation. You can control how bright or dim the backlight is. You can also turn the backlight off to save battery when you're in a well lit area. It's got plenty of space for hundreds of books.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my 12-year-old daughter. The camera, space, and design work perfectly for her. She loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this on black Friday for 35 bucks for my 2 year old for youtube viewing, for my 2 year old it's amazing does the job decent battery.It's not that fast or the screen ain't that great but for 35 bucks you get what you pay forI think it's great for kids if you need to do serious stuff on tablet and thinking you can get away with it with this tablet definitely do not buy it\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is a great speaker with clear sound that reaches from one room to another. The biggest problem that I have had us getting it to work with the Nest thermostat. The thermostat must be registered under the same email account as the echo, otherwise the Echo cannot remotely control it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it so far. Looking forward to connect whatever I can. It made my life easy already.\n",
      "Positive :-> We purchased this as a replacement for a tablet our son previously had. No bugs, no lagging, graphics are great, sound is great, lighting fast. Works perfect as we have an Amazon Prime account.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use and the kid friendly protector works great...\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent way faster stream you pay for what you get\n",
      "Positive :-> This was bought for my nephew for his birthday and he absolutely loves it..\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best electronic that I have bought in a longtime I love Alexa by echo I can play Pandora, iheart radio, Amazon music etc... The sound is great and the voice control is a big plus\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchase the echo with my Vivint system because sales person pushed the product stating it would enhance the Vivint capabilities. Not really so...it's a nice gadget for music and putting together shopping lists and \"to-do\" lists, but not really something we needed. In addition, not enough apps that work with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It's speedy when loading books!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this and I love it! It's easy to setup and easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> this device is awesome. all reviews and produt demo is correct.\n",
      "Positive :-> I chose the Paperwhite primarily because of the backlighting. I also own an original Kindle that does not have this feature. I love the new Paperwhite! I recently used it on a long trip and truly enjoyed the convenience and ease of use. I loved the fact that I did not have to turn on another light to read!\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased another Amazon Fire this year for my other grandson for Christmas. It is a very good buy for a child's first tablet. It does not have a lot of memory but can be expanded. The Amazon Fire allows for games, movies, and digital books to be used. The price is awesome for the value.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great streaming device and it provides a nice picture and access to streaming services.\n",
      "Positive :-> Really great for room not close to your internet router\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought one for each of my kids. Unbelievable the thing you can do. This one was for my husband. He loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> fun toy / tool / entertainmentplays pandora musicgets weather updatesnews\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm a huge fan of these tablets. If you aren't trying to spend a lot of money, or if you aren't an avid daily user, this will easily do all the basic necessities\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you.\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm super impressed with Alexa and how easy it was. Literally out of the box and connect to wifi and done.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my tablet for the price I paidWill buy again .\n",
      "Positive :-> over all it worked. was slower than my kindle paperwhite\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased a total of 3, one for each of my grandsons and one for me. Love reading on this kindle. One of my grandsons got a PS4 and he plays with his Fire rather than the PS4!\n",
      "Positive :-> BOUGHT FOR 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT AND NOW SHE WON'T NEED TO STEAL MOMS TABLET OR PHONE.\n",
      "Positive :-> Voyager is super easy to use and see, love the translations too!\n",
      "Positive :-> We had an older Kindle that needed to be upgraded. This is the same quality for less than half the price!! Love it and has a camera, our old one did not.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the echo after falling in love with the echo dot. The functionality of the speaker is fantastic and the sound quality is much better on this speaker than the dot. All in all a great speaker that's fun to use!\n",
      "Positive :-> Fast shipping from bestbuy.Com. product works great. For the price you can't go wrong.\n",
      "Positive :-> We had an earlier version of Kindle that in my opinion was hard to read the print. We purchased the Kindle paperwhite and love the brightness. It's much easier to read and doesn't strain my eyes.\n",
      "Positive :-> I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product easy to use. Having different color choices wonderful.\n",
      "Positive :-> Lightweight and handy. The screen is really easy on the eyes.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this and onother color at the same time. Great item no complaint\n",
      "Positive :-> The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT...\n",
      "Positive :-> I have three of these. They're great. But for how far along this product is, there is still a lot it can't do. And some of the things it can do only function after a very specific command. That being said, there is a lot it CAN DO! Especially via third party apps. Yea, some of the skills are useless. But it is worth the money for a smart home purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> This device works as advertised. The voice command on the remote is the best I've seen. Worth every penny.\n",
      "Positive :-> I ordered these for all of my grandkids. Easy to use. Just turned them on and ready to go.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the new Voyage bc it is lighter and smaller. Easier to tuck in my purse. The other plus is the auto light feature.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very nice. Easy to use. Got it to use with Amazon prime. Great combo.\n",
      "Positive :-> My husband set the Kindle for our grandson and he just loves it. Now he can read every day as well as play games, also he watches videos.\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves his Amazon Echo. It is a cool gadget to have.\n",
      "Positive :-> great response time, image quality is fantastic, easy to navigate\n",
      "Positive :-> Love having the Amazon Fire, are able to download apps, watch videos from Amazon Prime, and it includes profiles so kids can have access to it as well. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Positive :-> GOOD PURCHASE HAPPY WITH PRODUCT, WOULD RECOMMENDS\n",
      "Positive :-> got this newer charger as it was indicated to charge faster than the one that came with my fire hdx 8.9 4th generation tablet. well i am currently using this new charger and am getting alerts on the fire tablet that i am hooked up to a low power charger it is plugged directly into the wall socket with the 5ft micro-usb cable i also just bought for it. this is not right. is it junk is it false advertising is the fire tablet wrong in its notification what is the deal amazon. i have been a loyal user but this is really not right.\n",
      "Positive :-> Grand daughter is two years old and watches her older brother and sister use their iPads. So we got her the Amazon Fire Kids Addition and she loves it. She has a great time with learning numbers and the alphabet.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second fire I used last one all the time between grandkids and myself time to pass the old one down for them to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a Christmas gift for my son. He has been wanting one for a while and this was some of the best pricing I've seen\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this as a gift for my sister. She was running out of book shelf space this was the great idea. She loved this gift and it has a light so you can read this one in the dark.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product, makes life easier. Gaining in intelligence.\n",
      "Positive :-> Christmas presents for our girls. They work really well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy setup, I recommend hard wiring, if possible, it has all the apps we use, including Sling TV!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. Purchased for my wife to replace her fire hd. She loves the screen and the fact that it fits in her pocketbook.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately), it's a quality product to have.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the third Kindle Fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. I absolutely love this thing. It's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. My 6 year old and 3 year old both have a their own profile, each linked with different movies/games. Setup was pretty easy with choosing preferred content based on characters/themes appropriate for their age group. Moving our Disney and other digital copies of movies was equally easy after signing in. The battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge, which is plenty for our use. The biggest complaint is that the micro USB connection isn't the best. The cord has a tendency to come loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount. I've seen this problem with other Kindles as well. This is aa bunch problem if you think that you're charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down. It also makes it very difficult to use during a charge. The amazing amount of content that you get from the Amazon library with the included year is nice as well. My 6 year old gets to try a bunch of games that I otherwise wouldn't let him try since I'd have to pay and he most likely get tired of after 5 minutes. Overall, I'd say the best kid tablet out there.\n",
      "Positive :-> Super easy to read in any light! So easy to download books!\n",
      "Positive :-> It gives me viewing options that I love and the grand kids love playing the games\n",
      "Positive :-> once I learn how to use all of the apps I am sure I will enjoy it more but I do have trouble scrolling\n",
      "Positive :-> Waited quite a while before buying this Kindle reaader. Weighed it heavily against an iPad. Talked to friends about their experiences with reeaders. The Kindle just seemed l8ike it would do the job I wanted much betterand the price was fantastic. I have beeen pleasantly surprised with what a Kindle can accomplish and how easy it is to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet for my young nephew to watch videos on the go. It was to replace his iPad mini. This tablet does everything that he was doing on the iPad, is easy to use, and only a fraction of the cost. The advertising on it is a bit annoying, but can not complain with the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price, sounds great ,it can do alot of stuff\n",
      "Positive :-> Wonderful tablet for the price. Great for what I need. Not perfect for surfing the web but for reading, watching movies and listening to music it has been wonderful. Great deal!\n",
      "Positive :-> About what you'd expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good\n",
      "Positive :-> Good little tablet for what I wanted, a few games, reading, web browsing. Came to me with slight flaw in corner of screen where there is a spot that looks brighter than the rest of the screen but can't beat the price I got on sale $30!.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. I want one now.\n",
      "Positive :-> MY DAUGHTER JUST LOVES THIS. EASY TO USE AND SHE IS ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING SHE WANTED ON IT. GREAT PRICE GREAT PRODUCT\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. Great for the beach or reading at anytime anywhere\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a Christmas gift and it sounds amazing. And of course the integration is wonderful too.\n",
      "Positive :-> I replaced my kindle that I had for 4 years with the new one and after a short time was able to access all my books and continue reading the book that I was reading before I bought the new kindle. I am pleased with the new touch screen for moving to the next page, like that this one is smaller and easier to take in my purse. I did purchase a case and it is protective and durable. I will enjoy this kindle for years to come\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been looking for an e-reader with backlight so that I could read under low light conditions. This Kindle has met my needs.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon fire TV is so easy to use and its a great way to watch everything you want\n",
      "Positive :-> Satisfied so far. Look forward to the updates. I would purchase again.\n",
      "Positive :-> By far my favorite product to stream from. I purchased the stick afterwards but it is no where near as reliable as the tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> You get a multitasking tablet for an incredible price!\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I would of never have considered getting Alexa until I house sat and the owners had one. I love music and she could play every genre keep in mind you have to sign up for 2.99 monthly fee it is so convenient just to ask her to play music and the sound from such a small unit is phenomenal. I also purchased the starter kit for the lights she will turn them on and off by your request and you can set it up on a timer which is great when you're out of town .\n",
      "Positive :-> BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES.\n",
      "Positive :-> It works great specially whit the new ligth frature\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my nephew. He didn't know how to operate it. It is a little tricky. Would not recommend for a child\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a present for our son, turns out to be a great present for the family. Very easy to use and as advertised.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for reading, love the selection of apps to choose from.\n",
      "Positive :-> More confusing. It would be nice to have a manual that is not online.\n",
      "Positive :-> Gets the job done as a tablet I guess, apps are limited but this isn't meant to be a full on tablet, its a reader. It does freeze ad glitch a little but for the price I guess its worth it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is one of the best presents ever. Can control the entire house with your voice.\n",
      "Positive :-> WE PURCHASED THIS IN PLACE OF PAYING THE SKY HIGH CABLE PRICES FOR CHANNELS THAT WE JUST DO NOT USE. OUR TV IS A ROKU SMART TV, BUT WE FOUND THAT WE STILL NEEDED THIS TO GAIN ACCESS TO A FEW STATIONS. WE HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH OUR PURCHASE.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet but low internal storage and does not allow for much \"customization\" of the home screen and other screens.\n",
      "Positive :-> we love this tablet and the price. awesome deal. it was so good we going back to get two more. it's amazing .. can't say no more except get you one\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet works nice for reading and surfing the internet. It also has decent choice of games to download from Amazon. It also plays video decent, but the resolution on the screen on the screen is a little lacking, It is not an iPad Air, but as a basic tablet it functions well for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> For its size the speaker can still fill a pretty good sized room. We are really impressed with the sound quality. It's really cool how it can answer questions and shop for you. I also have it integrated with my Control4 system.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a huge hit as a gift for my 3 year old daughter.\n",
      "Positive :-> Has game selections, most my kids play. Great for daily use!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two of this at Christmas. Great for everyone in the family.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought as a birthday present for my GF. She uses it daily, and loves it.Easy to use, and convenient for those who are afraid to go full touch screen(they prefer buttons).\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows.\n",
      "Positive :-> Personally, I think the Kindle should have come with this item as 99 of people would need this. It works fine.\n",
      "Positive :-> Much better than the echo dot, was able to buy this for$99 promotion\n",
      "Positive :-> Best purchase I made this year. I got the Amazon TV box for the TV in the kitchen. I took the cable box back to the cable company. No more boxes I am savings money. The Amazon TV box have a faster download and the picture is clearer. I can watch my Netflix on the Amazon TV box and other lmovies and tv program. I going to purchase another box for my family room.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very useful products. I like very much . Perfect side . Very easy to navigate into\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm very happy i chose the amazon fire tablet. It's easy to use and i easily got the apps i needed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Device makes an excellent personal internet access machine! Some apps don't load on the device, but those are few and far between. Great music player as well as good interface with online streaming services such as Netflix. No need for a DVD player for the kids with this!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best thing I have ever bought, has amazing sound better than my Bose, she gives answers to your questions is fun to have takes very little space Love it\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a very good tablet for a first time user or a young child. The software is easy to use and the camera works great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great wife uses it everyday she downloads books from amazon\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for quickly charging your Kindle!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the voice commands, listening to music, books, or jokes! I've bought audible and house work goes by faster with books on Audible.\n",
      "Positive :-> Was looking for a simple tablet to use during my commute. This fits the bill. App store is limited, but this is good for simple web surfing or watching videos. Lightweight too. Only thing I don't like are the ads on the unlock screen (but, this is minor considering the price).\n",
      "Positive :-> Works as advertised.l\n",
      "Positive :-> It's not HD but it does the job: Facebook, recipes in the kitchen, streaming Spotify and pandora, Bluetooth is nice.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Purchased this to test it out. I have a prime membership. The interface seems a little slow and not as intuitive as other streaming players however do like the 4K capability for the price\n",
      "Positive :-> I love Alexa. She works exactly like I thought she would. A must have for every home.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Kindle & bought this for my mother for Christmas, she is very hard to get for but I know she will like it for the simple reason she can enlarge the letters just so she can see without having to put her glasses on. That in it self will mean everything to her. Now, she should be able to read her magazines or books or look something up online without any issues. Love Kindles!!\n",
      "Positive :-> My mom is an avid tablet user and I glad she got what she wanted\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the tablet as a gift and I helped set it up. It's a pretty good product for the price. It will mostly be used to read books for which it works really well.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great streaming device. Definitely worth the extra cost compared to the fire stick. Apps open instantly and operates flawlessly.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love that I can read all my books on here and search the internet!\n",
      "Positive :-> can't beat the price. thinking of buying a second one for myself as this was for my wife\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the third Alexa I've purchased...one for two homes and one for work. With Amazon Prime you can listen to music by just saying \"Alexa, play '70's rock\" it also gives you weather, turns on lights with add ons and gives you anything you'd normally have to get by logging on to a computer. \"alexa, what's the score of the Denver broncos?\" it tells you.\"alexa, how do you prepare chicken marsala?\" it tells you. get one!\n",
      "Positive :-> new tv is great.wife enjoying books on kindle..!!!!!!!!!!!!!1\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet overall just not enough memory but with an sd card just love it\n",
      "Positive :-> Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this pad for my boys. It is an excellent pad for a great price. They use it for all the popular apps, along with their favorite games. Sound, picture, and the touch screen are all great. I couldn't be happier with my choice. If your looking for a great pad at a great price, look no further, this is the pad!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it....the color is bright which makes it easy to find in a suitcase or carry on bag. I carry lots of stuff in my pocketbook because the color is neon yellow it stands out. So easy to grab and read. Took it on vacation loved it. I recommend the color cover rather than black one,\n",
      "Positive :-> upgraded from prior models and like all new features\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Echo is very helpful and just plain FUN. I use it primarily for * Weather, * music on pandora, * ask simple questions. There is SO much more you can do with this...but I have only scratched the surface. It was very easy to install/connect to my home wi-fi - no issues here. The music audio quality is fine for a small device. It \"hears\" me very well - even from the other room. I would have given it 5 stars if it was able to answer more difficult/different questions using its internet search.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tool for streaming, HD is awesome and sound is to, only wish it had ability to stream from USB stick or external HDD.\n",

      "Positive :-> This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this device as a dedicated reader with the occasional web browsing and video streaming and I am very happy with it for that purpose. It is the right size and the right weight. The Amazon case (sold separately) gives it a real book feel. If you are looking for more multi-purpose use, you may find this device frustrating - especially if you have invested in Google's ecosystem. The device runs on Fire OS - Amazon's flavor of Android - and app purchases are made through Amazon's app store. Google Play store and Google Services are not available on this device, and the most essential Google apps (e.g. YouTube) are not available in Amazon's app store. That said, it's still an excellent device for this price point.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the most incredible tablet for the price. I recommend to anyone who wants a dependable tablet and doesn't want to spend a fortune.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this as a birthday gift for my wife..she loved it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Not what I expected, I am not satisfied with the product\n",
      "Positive :-> I think the Echos are terrific personal assistants. This is my second large Echo. I like the larger speakers in the big Echo. But I also like the Dots well enough to buy five of them. Alexa is all over my house!\n",

      "Neutral :-> Wasnt really impressed with the operating system. Was hoping it was more of android style. Not so much.\n",
      "Positive :-> Worth the money! Use it all the time with no issues!\n",
      "Positive :-> This has become a great option for me to read anywhere. The best part is I have the Kindle app on my phone and it keeps track on the pages between the two devices. I'm very happy with this purchase!\n",

      "Positive :-> Best tablet for the price!Bought 2 of this and enjoying a lot!\n",
      "Positive :-> I gave my Paperwhite to a friend and bought the Voyage. I like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages. I don't know that it's really worth all of the extra cost compared to the Paperwhite, especially since the new one just came out with 300 dpi.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Echo so great, I have it running my air and lamps. performs great. Great product. Just ask a question and she gives the answer 99% of time correctly.\n",

      "Positive :-> I have had the Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) - Black for about 1 1/2 yrs, I love it. I have found the fire tv to be much better in regards to less buffering than the fire stick. Great product.\n",
      "Positive :-> I enjoy reading with my Kindle Fire. That is the reason I purchased it. Because I do not have Wi-Fi my use is limited.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great inexpensive product for the price. Just like the Kindle Fire HDX except for no mayday function. Both front and rear cameras are a plus. Love the Amazon kindle fire\n",
      "Positive :-> Great Device! Quick, easy to use and a great value!\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexis is very useful for many different fun apps.\n",

      "Positive :-> Buy this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a life saver on our recent cross country flight. It was nice not having to worry if my three year old was too rough with it, knowing it had a great Amazon warranty.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got the first version for my sister and she hasn't been able to put it down on over a year. Then I got her this one and forget about it. Great new features, she loves loves loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Amazon Fire tablet it does exactly what I needed to do.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for the home or office. The music sounds great and it can hear from across the room.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 3rd Amazon Fire TV (for different rooms) and it is such a great product. Much easier to navigate then the built in smart TV functions for watching other apps and it is much more responsive for searching for shows using the voice controlled search function.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the fact that I can have it play all types of music. The Alexa also helps with amazon shopping and current events.\n",
      "Positive :-> it is a great streaming device with all the apps you need for streaming whatever it is you watch, cut the cable go to streaming it will save a lot of money\n",
      "Positive :-> For the money, you really can't do much better in the tablet department. Quick, responsive and does everything you want it to do. Highly recommended\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use. Great for someone who wants to play some games and use simple apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch movies/tv, surf the net, email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products, but I am obviously not one of them.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter enjoy playing games and watching learning programs on device. Love the ability to secure adult information from kids by using a password.\n",
      "Positive :-> My mom is not computer savvy, however she has really taken to the tablet. It is easy to us and just the right size for her to handle. So glad that Best Buy recommended this product for her.\n",
      "Positive :-> I dropped cable tv entirely, and I purchased this device to use with my sling box. It works wonderfully and is very easy to set up. It also integrated well with my harmony remote.\n",
      "Positive :-> Right price my son loves it great for games and you tube\n",
      "Positive :-> This product did not disappoint me. I purchased it on the deal of the day and do not regret it for a second. Great sound quality and unbelievably accurate with voice commands.\n",
      "Positive :-> Small, portable, light and fun to use. It charged fast\n",
      "Positive :-> Love how many possibilities there are with this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is for my mom who only knows the basics of technology. You can play games on it and social networks easily. Anything more advanced I wouldn't recommend. Great product starter tablet for am amazing price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Every time I use the echo I find there is something else that it can do. There is not a day that I don't find use for it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Now I will admit I am a tech gal. I did do some investigations before buying. I was not dissapointed at all. This is like your own personal assistant. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, spell,set alarm,check weather,traffic,news update,even tells jokes. I love the fact that anyone can talk to it and it will still work. My family and friends have pure entertainment with this neat gadget. I look forward to seeing more things added to the commands. Also was super easy to set up and the volume is way better than expected.\n",
      "Positive :-> good table good resoultion its better than the old table version my kids love it\n",
      "Positive :-> I had one of the older kindles but decided to buy this one because you can read in the dark. What a great decision!!! Recommend to anyone that enjoys reading.\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo is a great product that continues to improve. I love the white!\n",
      "Positive :-> I never expected this small device could have so many features. Its good but you need to buy a memory extension\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to scroll through the menu t watch what you want.just less the price of others\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for streaming and an E-reader at a great price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle is great as long as you only use it to read books. The web interface is pretty rough, so I put books on it straight from my computer. I love that you can e-mail files directly to your kindle! The lighting is also much improved from the last time I had an e-reader (the Nook) and is perfect whether you're reading inside, outside, or in the dark.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not bad can with stand my almost 2 yr old daughters wrath of every day wear and tear. So it's a win for me....\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best and probably only e-reader that you need. Screen is beautiful and perfect with built-in light. However, I would like one with bigger screen size and hope amazon could improve reading performance on Pdf files.\n",
      "Positive :-> Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads.\n",
      "Positive :-> Have to learn to talk to it properly, it can do things with WeMo better than reviewed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome gadget plays music answers questions tells the time.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this with the intent for using it mostly for music, and now we use it to get news updates, weather, and the occasional joke. Kids love playing with it too, so it is nice to have the mute button.\n",
      "Positive :-> A nice tablet for the money. I use the Fire as a secondary tablet to by iPad but I find I use it as much as the iPad. Great for traveling because of its size. I am happy with the purchase. I have found that it charges fine when using the cord/plug that comes with the unit but charges slow if you use a different cord/plug.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is a good kids tablet and or for prime users. Not a laptop replacement or for non amazon users\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased as a gift for the mother-in-law who needed a new device for reading books. Even at the suggested retail it's a rather remarkable bargain; with Black Friday pricing it was a steal. Excellent graphics, convenient size.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is affordable and it had Increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better!\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for streaming off internet , no buffering on Lodi and live tv !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my 7 year old son & he loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for beginners to use. Easy operating system\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls.\n",
      "Positive :-> I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> Don't like all the ads. Didn't know that they would be permanent because I bought it on sale. It's very slow and has trouble connecting to my wifi.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice 7 \" screen for less than 50.0. Bought 3Gave to relatives . They love them\n",
      "Positive :-> Product works as described. Product was also very easy to install and set up.\n",
      "Positive :-> Needs to be a way to lock screen. Kiddo loves the device for books and movies on long road trips but accidentally turns off screen or clicks out of it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it.\n",
      "Positive :-> When I picked up this product, I ordered 2 additional for Christmas. They sent me to the MOA store and said they are in stock. I received the text from Best Buy stating that they have been picked for me. Once I arrived they had one, but stated the other one had been sold. I asked if they could get another from another location and they simply stated that it was a popular item for Christmas and they are probably out of stock. After asking four times, I picked up the phone and called Duluth since the website stated that they had some. The store manager looked at me and decided I was serious about checking another store. I spoke with a rep in Duluth and he state that he just got off the phone with the manager of the MOA location and he was shipping one to MOA. So, I hung up the phone, about 5 minutes later the manager came back out to talk to me and he stated they didn't have anymore. I mentioned that I spoke with someone there and he spoke with the manager at MOA and was shipping it to him. The manager denied that he spoke with him. I requested someone from Best Buy leadership contact me and still have not heard from anyone at best Buy. The manager I dealt with at the MOA was Link.\n",
      "Neutral :-> I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I'm a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is an incredible asset to our home and she even plays music for our dog when we are not at home.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice way to stream movies, .......................\n",
      "Positive :-> I'd been using my phone as my e-reader but have wanted to get a stand-alone reader for a while. The screen on this is amazing and the light is a great addition. If you're on the fence- go for it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought it for my niece who is 7 seven years old. She loves it and she learns from the applications included.\n",
      "Positive :-> Comments on Kindle Paperwhite1) Basic functioning of page forward & back - excellent2) Footnote action often led to loosing place. It was easy to accidentally press a footnote when doing normal forward or back. Pressing the top right x sometimes returned to text, but often was dead - requiring selecting Go To Footnotes. Picking the correct < footnote returned to correct position - but too easy to accidentally press a different footnote - send me off to wrong text position. While doing things right raises no problems - it is to easy to get in trouble. Enabling the x at all times would be safer.3) Occasionally a small print message such as 91 highlighters would appear between the lines. Supposed to show where other kindle users highlighted text. Does not highlight any text.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product...no problems at all. If your looking for a great media streaming look no further than the Amazon Fire TV.\n",
      "Positive :-> Much faster than the stick in every way (wifi, processor, and ram). I like this a lot more than the stick it's just snappier.The voice remote is useless. I still prefer the Apple TV 4, over AFTV.\n",
      "Positive :-> I don't care for the lack of storage or the strange arrangement and naviagation through the software. Nonetheless it's nice for its price\n",
      "Positive :-> Glad I decide to purchase it on black Friday . You can do anything on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very happy with my purchase, totally recommend this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> My wife uses for watching movies, reading, Pandora etc...honestly does everything her more expensive tablets did.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have a smart TV but the Fire TV is faster and extremely more flexible. It is the best value of all units I reviewed. I have highly recommend the Fire TV and Fire Stick to my friends. They too have purchased and love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great outside speaker and alexa is really great to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! It has parental controls also (which she doesn't love)!\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this tablet on Black Friday. It was a great price, and being a Prime member, it has become my favorite entertainment venue on the go. The screen's not as sharp as an iPad or Samsung tablet, but for the price I got it for and its entertainment value, it can't be beat.\n",
      "Positive :-> The fore lived up to its reviews. Great tablet for my elementary age grandchildren.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been quite impressed with what a wonderful tool my new Kindle is for such a low price! My wife loves it!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I use it everyday! I absolutely love my echo! Best Buy ever!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He used to look up everything on his smartphone, and watched Netflix on it too, but this tablet beats it with speed and overall performance. It also takes really good pictures. Every member of my family owns one of the Kindle Fire tablets.\n",
      "Positive :-> When I was looking for something to get so I could have all my books on one the Kindle is the first thing I thought of and ended up getting. The only thing I don't like about it is when it is dark the screen can be kind of bright even with the blue shade on. I also I have trouble spelling on the keyboard.\n",
      "Positive :-> It has good sound and can pick up my voice in a normal speaking tone.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent tablet! I purchased for someone in a nursing home and she loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my new Kindle! Very easy to use and a great price!!! I take it everywhere!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased to use as a kiosk for an app. Great value.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use and very fast. Like the fact that you can expand the memory through a mini sd card.\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm gradually learning all of the features the Kindle Fire has and am enjoying the books I've downloaded.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loves it and you can't beat the warranty!\n",
      "Positive :-> I've used one before and loved the size, weight and feel.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my niece as her first tablet. She was so excited!!\n",
      "Positive :-> We really love our Echo. We have so much fun playing around with her.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it. My second Kindle. Carry it with me all time. A crazy reader's favorite.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought it for my Dad to play games and to download books on it so he won't drain his phone battery.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my mom. Decent tablet not heavy and good pirce. She loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Kindle! It's perfect for reading my favorite books!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it for the price paid. Perfect holiday gift for kids and adults.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this 8\" model to use in addition to my current 3 year old Kindle Fire HD (7 inch model). So far I am very pleased with the quality of this unit. The slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. I didn't want the larger 10\" screen (yet).\n",
      "Positive :-> With amazon prime I was able to create a huge play list. My Echo also turns on lights in some of the most inconvenient areas. Alexa keeps me informed on news weather and sports.\n",
      "Positive :-> good product for less price.Best deal from bestbuy\n",
      "Positive :-> My grandson love this tablet alot of great games and learning activities.\n",
      "Positive :-> the kids use it every chance they get, this is the fourth one we have bought.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome for kidsIt's educationalI love the blue cover!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> My 8 year old loves his fire he takes it everywhere we go!\n",
      "Positive :-> First, the good news. The screen is a nice brightness and the words are crisp and clear. Best of all, it is so light and tiny (esp. in the Origami case) that it is super-easy to carry around in a purse. Love that. Also it has an amazing battery life; I have never had it run out on me and I don't even have to recharge it all the time. I thought this would be perfect but I am having two problems: (1) turning pages is not as easy or pleasant as my much-older, now-defunct Kindle. If I don't touch the screen in the right place, the page won't turn, and it usually has an annoying split-second black flash on the screen. The ancient Kindle was easier. (2) About half the time, when I return to reading, the screen is \"frozen\" on the ad. It says \"swipe to open\" but no amount of swiping gets it going. I have to reach to the rear of the kindle (which means disassembling the crimp in the Origami) to press the button on the back to get it to function again. There is no rhyme nor reason to when this happens but it's about half the time. Perhaps I am doing something wrong regarding both flaws but there is no one to ask about it, Best Buy staff doesn't know.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tech product but needs more basic information. Constantly states that not able to answer my questions at this time. Might need more information on how to program for more content information.\n",
      "Positive :-> great for reading outside in the sun, or in dark rooms. very easy on the eyes.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased 2 of these and am real satisfied with them!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the size and screen. Wish there was a chrome app for Kindle, but great for casual surfing. Great for ebooks.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am able to stream movies without any buffering issues and the voice command makes searching for shows very easy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet and kid case. I just wish it came with kids apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet to have for the kids and me to play games, read books, etc. I just wish it was able to get more of the apps that are on android\n",
      "Positive :-> Cool item for a great price! Purchased when on sale so was like $39.99! Great little tablet!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an absolute steal at the price! Great product with great functionality!\n",
      "Neutral :-> It's slippery u cannot hold it it always slips and lots of ads definitely not good if u don't like advertising\n",
      "Positive :-> So awesome and cool, the future is here!! I can't wait to have her run mu house lights!\n",
      "Negative :-> my son had a nabi we bought for learning & entertainment. there were many games we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it. But we habe yet to encounter a problem with the fire! i download games and books for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> After a lot of internal debate, review reading and getting tired of trying to hold onto my iPad in bed, I broke down and purchased this e-reader. To which I am truly glad that I made the purchase.It is light, easy to read, has a great battery life and a does not have the distractions of a smart phone or tablet. For these reasons, I'd highly recommend adding this tech to your arsenal.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great screen, fast and responsive touch controls, and linked to Amazon for your apps. Overall, the best tablet you can find for under $50.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 2 yr old loves his tablet. Best purchase ever. It has great educational videos and is easy for him to work on his kids profile. Amazon got it right!\n",
      "Positive :-> If you are as invested into the Amazon ecosystem as I am, you can never have too many of these.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second Amazon Fire TV product, first I had the Fire TV stick which was great but a little under-power so I went ahead and upgraded to the Fire TV box and I have to say that this box is great. The streaming picture is gorgeous!! I am using it hard wired so I can't talk about the Wifi, but the videos load basically instantly and it never looks pixelated. I installed Kodi and it works great!!, Alexa is very handy and can even do shopping lists for you. The only thing that I don't like is that the search feature on the box it only gives you results from the Amazon Video store, it doesn't give you results from Netflix, Hulu or others. It has a MicroSD card slot which is very handy if you are planning to download a lot of games, the remote works great and comes with batteries. Overall is a great box and if you have an Amazon Prime subscription is definitely a must!! You won't find a better and more organized Amazon instant video app.\n",
      "Positive :-> My last kindle died right before Christmas. I was lost with no way to read my books. Went to Best Buy to look at all the different ones available. Found that the Voyage was the best for my situation. Being backlit was perfect for the many different places I read, car, work, restaurants, and planes.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have the older Kindle with keyboard. This one is lighter, touchscreen, and has the back light. It was worth the extra $ to buy this one with the backlight. My daughter doesn't need to worry about whether she has a book light with her when she reads on long trips. A+\n",
      "Positive :-> Hands down the best ereader available. I researched several devices and it came down to the Paperwhite and the Voyage. There is a pretty hefty price premium for the Voyage. Most people will probably be very satisfied with the Paperwhite. I typically need reading glasses to read regular size print. On an eReader the font can be adjusted to make it large enough so I don't need to use the glasses. That means less text on each page and many more page turns. The physical \"buttons\" hep make the page turns easier and extra light brightness helps to add contrast to the text. These were enough to sell me on the Voyage. It was the right decision and I love the device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up parental controls and email notification are a great tool on the tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> Great sound and syncs well with andriod phones. Good buy\n",
      "Positive :-> We found this to be an excellent music source. Signed up for the $3/month Unlimited Amazon Music subscription. It's great to be able to request any kind of music at any time. Speaker quality is excellent as well. It was very easy to setup. Love that you can add items directly to a shopping list or a to do list. I would have given this 5 stars if the Search feature was more robust.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect gift for my mom who was homebound after surgery. Made the time go by so much faster!\n",
      "Positive :-> One of the best TV boxes on the market hands down.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a birthday gift for my daughter but I must say I want one for myself! Great sound and easy to operate.\n",
      "Positive :-> For the price, it cannot be beat. The screen isn't the best quality but for the price it is sufficient\n",
      "Positive :-> This item is so great. I love it. I bought 2 of this before and gave it to my family member and they loved it too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet - great apps and performance. I Love it \"\n",
      "Positive :-> No problems here, although it's such a simple and common product that it seems a little pricey. Works well with charger for Kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. The kids can watch their movies and videos, or I can read from my kindle library. Perfect size.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for a Christmas present for her and she loves it. Helps that I am a prime member as well cuz she can download more movies and so on.\n",

      "Positive :-> The resolution is obviously more subtle than my old kindle but the back light is not very even, especially on the bottom. It's a common issue for the new generation.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have to say Alexa has been a great disappointment. Most of the time she doesn't know the answer to anything and tells us that she doesn't understand the question. I thought this thing was supposed to get smarter as it goes along. We had to sign up for AMAZON Prime and Unlimited Music just to actually listen to decent music. When she does know a command for example like say \"Loop Mode\" when you want her to repeat a song... most of the time she understands that. And then there are a lot of times when she simply beeps out or even says she doesn't understand the question no matter how many times you say it. We use her mostly for a timer, alarm, play music and for 6 questions of Jeopardy a day. Really needs a lot of improvement. Ask her what a dog says.. she says bow wow or woof. *Sigh* If she can only be basic on that answer, there isn't much more she is gonna get right. There are also a lot of pretty useless skills for her available. We got it at a discounted price thankfully and I also got a Dot for in the bedroom at a cheaper price. Dot is even worse at listening to commands than Echo is.\n",

      "Positive :-> Great for my 5 year old because he can play anything on there without having to ask me to install. (In a previous tablet, he had to ask me to install games, videos, etc.. but that is no longer the case). Being able to set time limits is great as well.

      "Positive :-> Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.\n",

      "Positive :-> This is perfect. I wanted to cut the cord and I used the free 30 day amazon prime trial. I definitely recommend getting playstation vue!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I was looking for the slingbox app. Not many devices seem to support watching slingbox on a TV (not sling TV). This worked great!\n",

      "Positive :-> much easier to see games than iphone and to read:)\n",

      "Positive :-> The screen is very sharp and easy to use. The letters are crisp and distinctive. The back light works well in the dark or light. I have no problem reading at night in the dark or during the day outside in direct sunlight. The new page press buttons are perfectly placed and very convenient. It's light weight and small enough to hold in one hand whole reading. I only have to charge it every 2 weeks.I would recommend this edition to anyone who enjoys reading.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was my first Kindle, wonderful reading device.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for our kids for a road trip, we loaded some movies prior to the trip and I must say it was very quiet for once. At night I was able to use it to catch up on some reading. Nice tablet for the price.\n",

      "Positive :-> I got this after returning google home, because I had multiple bedrooms and I wanted a platform to connect them together, you would had to buy multiple google home which is expensive solution, however with echo you can combine it with alexa dot -which is a lot cheaper- in the rooms that you don't need large speakers and keep echo in the living room or so. I found that I can integrate a lot applications and devices through Alexa app which wasn't available in google home. I would definitely recommend you getting this product verses google home.\n",

      "Positive :-> We purchased the Amazon Echo as a family gift, it has had great reviews so far.\n",

It's easier to read in dark situations or on flights at night. I love the differences the new improved kindle provides.\n",

      "Positive :-> I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn't expecting too much at that price point. This isn't as good as a iPad but at that price it's pretty close and worth every penny.\n",

      "Positive :-> This is the best reading tablet to date, crystal clear and bright\n",
      "Positive :-> We got this tablet for our grandkids for Christmas so they would leave their parents phones alone. This way they can play all the games that they want on a device that is not quite as pricey as the smartphones. They love the tablet, but we needed to block the purchases from our grandson who is only 4, as he downloaded a game on Christmas that was not free before we could stop him. Our fault.\n",

      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet for my sister as a Christmas present.\n",
      "Positive :-> worth the price you pay for the product. thank you\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device don't much like the mandatory advertising\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good tablet for the money. Recommended for first time tablet owners.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is what it has come to. You can now buy a quality tablet for $50. Amazing! Works well, just couple things. It uses amazon app store, not, Google play store. It runs an OS called Fire 5.0, which is based on android OS. So you may not find apps that are available the same as android. Of course, all of the big name apps are there. But if you want to hold a good quality piece of hardware in your hands for not a lot of money, this is a great choice. Amazon has a philosophy. They want to make money AFTER the sale. So that's why they get you in at a low price. Also, they have created a revenue stream by selling ads. When your screen times out, it will post a \"screen saver/wallpaper\" that is an advertisement. If you want, you can go to your amazon account, pay a one time $15 fee (per unit, not per account) to get rid of them,\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for granddaughter, age 11. She had no trouble setting everything up, even though she'd only been familiar with Apple's phone, ipod and ipad. Her only regret was no \"Facetime\", so Skype will suffice. Video quality is great, can't beat the price!\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had Amazon Kindles since v1. Each new release surpasses the one before it, as you would expect, but does so in ways that always improve the user experience. I love the feel of this one - great size, great weight, and I love the backlit screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this primarily to be used as a Kindle eReader and this is a good product for this cost.. The only drawback is that I cannot access all the apps available on the Google PlayStore and have to be content with what is available on the Amazon app store.\n",
      "Positive :-> For $50 i wasnt expecting high end screen resolution.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought 2 Dots for myself and this one for my parents. They are in their 80s and they use Amazon to play music and I use it to drop in on them. They also use the Echo to call me in an emergency.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the tablet but, I don't like all the ads...\n",
      "Positive :-> I can do everything I need on this tablet while traveling - check my email, browse the internet with the silk browser app, youtube, free app games etc. Because I have an amazon prime account as well, I linked my tablet to it so I can access a huge variety of free music, tv and movies. There are several offline options to load files onto the SD card, or to your tablets memory, so you can watch movies or use it as a mp3 player while away from internet. I watched a 2 hour movie on the airplane and only went through 30% of the battery power. Beautiful screen, loud speakers with the option for headphones. I have no reason to want anything more expensive, such as an ipad or surface since this does all I need while away from home.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second Amazon Fire, purchased it from Best Buy for a Christmas gift, when a deal was running. After opening the package found a scratch on the screen. Took the product to Store Best Buy changed it promptly. The new one is quiet right.\n",

      "Positive :-> Battery life is awesome. Works great with the lights off and goes to sleep after a few minutes of non use\n",
      "Positive :-> Thumbs up. This was a good substitute to replace the current cable provider you use. Canadian customers would like this the best.\n",
      "Positive :-> We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile.\n",
      "Positive :-> The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really like the simplicity of the Amazon Fire Stick. It is a great product from when I am on the go and I can plug it in where ever I have a WiFi connection. It is easy to use and simple. If you are looking for basic but functional, Fire TV is a good buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my kids as a gift. They love this device and use it daily. I couldn't be happier with the purchase\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. I love that it has so much memory space, so I can download tons of games and activities to keep him occupied on long rides. I love the 2 year warranty and safety case. He loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good and easy to use and to set up. Use it more than regular tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Firebox along with Alex I can ask almost anything and Alex will let me know\n",
      "Positive :-> The echo provides great sounds paired with Alexa makes it a great buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> G'kids came over early for Christmas, ages 7 and 10. They opened basketball hoop and backboard, a camera, Lego toys BUT they went \"CRAZY\" when they opened the \"FIRE\" tablets. By the time they went home they had already downloaded game apps to play. Thanks for a great Christmas ...\n",
      "Positive :-> Wife liked it and that's what matters. Right? Not a bad tablet for reading for the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> The best tablet I have had! Overall its great.Great camera, tools, apps & great battery! That will last.\n",
      "Positive :-> This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very simple to set up and works great right out of the box. Automatically creates to do lists and shopping lists which you can access through the app. This has become my favorite feature and I didn't even know about it when I bought the unit!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased for my son for Christmas and he loves it /. Great price\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter for her birthday. She loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> The quality of the display is amazing - the battery life is fantastic\n",
      "Positive :-> If you want a device that performs on command, Alexa is her name.She's a constant companion in the kitchen. She sings, tells jokes, shares recipes, tells stories, quotes Bible verses, gives me the weather forecast and so much more.If you add the additional devices you can control your lights or thermostat. My grandson really likes Alexa because she tells him stories.This inanimate object begins to feel like a real person the longer you have it around.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is quick and intelligent. She can hear you from way farther than I expected. Music and audio sound great as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome product great value! I can stream from Netflix and Hulu and is much faster than the FireStick.\n",
      "Positive :-> this is the best house helper and entertainer. a must for everyone\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome product for reason on the go! And great quality doesn't hurt my eyes and I can see it clearly day or night!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You're never too old to learn new things.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a gift/prize for a Project Graduation party. The winner was super excited!\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire TV works great and is very fast. Some apps are in the cloud but others have to be purchased through Amazon. Only problem was getting battery cover off of remote\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this Alexa! Great sound! Technology has come a long way!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product and makes reading books very easy. Very light and allows you to have access to numerous books on the go. The E-paper display makes reading really enjoyable and does not suffer from glare and the harsh back light from the displays on phones and tablets\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the small size as it is very comfortable to hold... the look and feel is very much like an actual book!!\n",
      "Positive :-> we get what we paid for but at $49 this machine is much better than any of the cheap tabs that are in market. the screen resolution and the performance is pretty decent for this grade of tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought both this and the fire stick. I like the box better becuase it has more storage than the stick. It's also easy to use and operate. All in all I think it's a good purchase and would recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought one at the store and liked it so got one for my daughter inlaw for Christmas\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an outstanding tablet, especially for the money. Does all I need it to do at a great price.\n",
      "Positive :-> amazon fire tv box is awesome i love using netflix in 4k!\n",
      "Positive :-> My grandkids love these tablets.They are easy for them and they are having a great time with them\n",
      "Positive :-> bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for\n",
      "Positive :-> This fire tv is awesome! Not only is it easy to set up and use but I'm saving a ton of money on cable :)\n",
      "Positive :-> Got fort my kid, had Christmas and birthday money. Wanted their own tablet and worked good as we are prime members.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa works good for the controls and ways that I am using the system. Using to control some home automation (lights, thermostat, etc).\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great little tablet to carry around. Love that it is easy on my eyes and has very clear picture.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought one of these to get something to try out Kodi, as a streaming media device it works really well. I love the fact you can have your Netflix and other apps right at hand, I can still run plex and Kodi installs In a matter of minutes. Nice to have a single device to run all my needs and totally replaced the need for cable. The sticks work well but the extra grunt of this is worth the additional spend.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was worried about what I'd be compromising with a 49 dollar tablet, but this kindle is extraordinary for the specs. Yes it has a mono speaker and it's not HD but it's a fast performing tablet and you can't really tell. I don't regret this purchase at all!\n",
      "Positive :-> The value was there with a sale price reduction of $30. Especially for the 16GB model. Another key factor is the 2 year no questions asked warranty replacement. A valuable consideration for a tablet primarily used by a child.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the picture, easy to navigate, light weight and easy travel size . I bought 4 for Christmas presents.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Apple Watch is great. I am very happy with the purchase.\n",
      "Neutral :-> For the price this works fine as a reader. I had the original Fire and was disappointed when it quit charging. I'm hoping that I don't have the same problem with this.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is very user friendly and worked well for my travel needs!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great item to use with kids. I like adding memory as needed. I love the kindle fire aspects....some items can be read by text to speech.I think the kids will like the camera, their old kindle fires did not have this.\n",
      "Positive :-> I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys amazon. Excellent value.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games .\n",
      "Positive :-> The device itself is funtional and gives you access to many types of services ex: netflix, hulu, amazon prime, and much more. It also allows you to customize it by side loading programs. Its not a bad little device but I prefer its big brother the amazon fire tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> We went from a Roku 1 to this and are very pleased. Not fair to compare the two as the Roku 1 is old tech. You would have to compare it to the Roku 4. This streams very smoothly. Look and feel are great. So is voice search for Amazon Prime content.\n",
      "Positive :-> this tablet works great for my 5 year old who likes to watch kid videos. Set parental locks and it works just like any of the 125- 200 dollar tablets.... for $50... my kid is happy and I am happy\n",
      "Positive :-> great everyday simple web surfing and apps on this tablet for the price. Good to used it on the plane and watch movies or videos. Processor not as fast as your premium ipad.\n",
      "Positive :-> This latest version of the kindle reader is great. Paper white is esp nice.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased 3 of these as christmas gifts for nieces & nephew.\n",
      "Positive :-> Just speak into the remote and your thrust on a journey through movies,Internet and shopping.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works Great, Flixster is a little slow compared to vudu but at least I can still view my movies from vudu.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent e-reader and great deal. Cover is perfect.\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm a big fan of Kindle tablets so i got one for all the kids for christmas\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet if you have an amazon prime account. Not able to download some apps that are current. works better if you stay with in amazon.\n",
      "Positive :-> Still discovering the many uses for the Echo. So many uses being discovered daily!\n",
      "Positive :-> Enjoying this Streaming Device. I can watch my favorite Movies and Shows on 4K UHD Quality\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loves it. She can make her videos and listen to her music.\n",
      "Positive :-> What can I say? The Amazon Fire is a great tablet . The price is fantastic . Good size . Does the job . Great deal at Best Buy\n",
      "Positive :-> The echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information. However in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated, automated home, it lacks much. I purchased it to use with Philips hue bulbs and I was hoping my fire tv. Although it shares the same software with the fire, and logically should be able to work together, it does not. Echo will not connect to or control the tv. As far as the Philips hue bulbs, it can turn on individual bulbs, or even a group of bulbs IF, and only if, you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it. It cannot dim the lights, set light scenes or any of the cooler options the Philips hue bulbs are capable of. I wound up going back to using my iPhone which respond to voice command of 'hey Siri' better than the echo anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved the money and gone with a simple Bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does. Only difference is that the phone doesn't have as big of a range for voice pickup.I did give the echo three stars, because the one thing it does well is respond to questions, like what's the weather like. That feature is interesting but not worth paying nearly $200 for.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to get started with usefulFeatures. As I learn of new skills and try them Alexa gets more entertaining. Efficient and helpful assistant.\n",
      "Positive :-> offers a lot for the price, good parental controls\n",
      "Positive :-> Does everything I expected it to do. Definitely a great product for folks who want a good product with an affordable price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for kids gotta love amazon they are the best!\n",
      "Positive :-> Like it very much. Enjoy using it. The whole family participates and has fun.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good gift for my grandchild. She loves it. I'm a little unhappy with the navigation of the tablet from exiting a screen to return to the home screen. Especially when wanting to exit a game or video screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for my nephew and he loves it;his old one was slow and the space for bigger apps was limited.Good parental controls.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is better than we expected and couldn't be happier.\n",
      "Positive :-> Cheap tablet for someone that knows little about the internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have four siblings and it keeps them quiet days they're home\n",
      "Positive :-> It's exactly what you'd think it would be. No more, no less...a perfect e-reader for traveling and backpacking.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to use mainly outdoors because my iPad had too much reflection on the screen. The white background works great outdoors. Very easy to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it. Sound is decent. Not the best lows but with all the features it's not a big deal. I can do a lot of things with this little speaker. Will be buying more for other rooms.\n",
      "Positive :-> Unleash all the tv shows and experiences you wanted to with this Amazon Fire TV box. Even better if you have a Prime account. I could watch all my entertainment right. No more high cable bills.\n",
      "Positive :-> The only thing I don't like is I can put my books in order\n",
      "Positive :-> Affordable introduction to data centered assistance. Does pull you more deeply into the Amazon ecosystem.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought it for myself. Loved the price and it works pretty well for $39. Didn't break the bank at all, very happy with this purchase!\n",
      "Positive :-> Entertaining and fun to quiz and listen to. Music is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Or at least a future I'd like to be living in :-)Lets get this straight. As a Prime member, you can get this for 99. At that rate, think of it as:- A wireless speaker that you can just issue spoken instructions to!- An alarm clock that you can shout at (Alexa! Shut up!) in the morning, and it will obey you :) (its my half asleep morning power trip)- Set a timer for when you're cooking- Fact check your friend while you argue with them :PSo my common use cases aside, here's what is good about Echo:- Speech recognition works *really* well, esp for brief phrases.- It can hear you from pretty much anywhere in the room, and is pretty accurate with the wake word (I've been using Alexa)- As a music player, its really nice to be able to just ask for a song by name and have it just come up, without having to hunt through a playlist, connect to the bluetooth speaker etc.- Purchasing music is pretty seamless. (As if Amazon needed another way to get you to spend money:-) )- iHeart radio integration, if you're into that kinda thingHere is what is not so great:- Speech recognition for longer phrases needs a couple of attempts, maybe because of my accent. (e.g. Alexa, play the song The Troubles by U2- As a music player, its a bit lacking in bass.- Sometimes, while its playing music, you have to use the wake word once or twice to gets its attention- Bing search Really *rolls eyes*I'd love to see in the future:- Integration with Fire TV, so that I can simply say Alexa, play The Sopranos on my TV- Google search- Being able to send a message to a friend in my contacts Alexa, message XYZ blah blah blahOverall, its a pretty cool product, and I'd love to see what it looks like over time!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this unit for my daughter who loves to read but sometimes get frustrated by the size format of paper books and the weight of traditional tablets. The e-ink is super easy to read and the unit weighs next to nothing. A bit spendy for something you can only use to read on but so so nice to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to give as a door prize gift for a nonprofit. they loved it, I was impressed with the reviews and proud to donate it as a gift.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's simple to use and I've had no issues. Do need decent internet speed to stream live tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> For the price & quality this produce is great for gifts or for the person that likes to read on the go.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price on Black Friday. Bought for my grandson. Interface is a little different but a good purchase\n",
      "Positive :-> Growing up I didn't have electronics but this thing is awesome for kids. You can limit usage and break down how much time they can spend doing certain things. Great buy\n",
      "Positive :-> still learning new things about my tablet. very easy to use.. perfect size.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is great for kids. Plays movies and games and is relatively inexpensive. The processor is not nearly as fast an iPad or iPhone but cost a fraction of the price and works great for kids.\n",
      "Positive :-> the only downside of it is that you can't have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os\n",
      "Positive :-> I would say about 50% of the questions you ask are answered - far too much I do not know. You do not get that same level when yopu google something so not sure why the difference. I would hope there would be further upgrades you can download.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought the Fire for my son. Excellent product for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a must buy!!!! Great picture you will enjoy this product\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great. Easy to set up. Use with app on Iphone, Bought plug for lamp and use it to turn off and on even when not home.Speakers are excellent. Picks up voice even from far away. I recommend this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Just bought a my first house and this was a fantastic addition as I unpack. I have an Amazon Prime account which gives me amazon music, so I've just been requesting music as I unpack and clean. Solid\n",
      "Positive :-> Seemed pretty simple to set up. Thinking about getting one for myself.\n",
      "Positive :-> Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts.\n",
      "Positive :-> it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon....\n",
      "Positive :-> I had been eyeing the Amazon Echo for a while now. Best Buy had a sale for 50% off (normally $199 it was $90) so I jumped on it. I absolutely love my Amazon Echo. It was everything I imagined it would be and more. If I had to do it all over again I would have paid the $199.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bargain price for a fully functioning tablet. Not the fastest but certainly capable. Recommended!\n",
      "Positive :-> The kindle is easy on the eyes to read. The light doesn't make the screen look like a computer screen which I was worried about. Simple and easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my father in law who is not tech savvy. The free \"May Day\" feature is the best part- I don't get called for tech support all of the time.\n",
      "Positive :-> Absolutely just a fun devices lots of options. Learn the device and learn the abilities it can do!!\n",
      "Negative :-> This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use and kid friendly. The price is more than fair on these and offers some decent viewing options. If it breaks no big deal to replace it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera\n",
      "Positive :-> I was hesitant and unsure of the value of the Echo, but was curious so I picked it up when it went on sale. The device is amazing - in that it can detect your voice and what you say even over background noise, clearly play music and speak.Since then I find I use it for regular news and weather updates, to play music, control lights and the temperature via ecobee3 integration, and I'm just getting started. There are thousands of \"skills\" that you can enable to customize the echo to do what you want.\n",
      "Positive :-> Super fast. Lots of storage. Great tablet for anyone.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product and fits all my needs. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a tablet for elderly people. They seem to have no problem using it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet works like nothing I've ever had Long lasting battery and great running system, , fast browser even faster app downloading,\n",
      "Positive :-> I love so far. processes at decent speed I've been able to do what I need without problems. I only wish all the apps on screen didn't have to be visible. Can't enjoiy a screen saver if its covered with icons\n",
      "Positive :-> You can't buy a lousy no brand for this price. Kid friendly. Don't you cringe when your wife gives her brand new iPhone or iPad to the 2 year old. Download apps and a movie or two from Disney and you can have a long peaceful drive in the car with a happy child. If you've bought movies with digital copies you can download them to this device for free. You need to buy a memory chip to expand memory capacity. Plenty of free apps on amazon as well. We bought several on black Friday and have no regrets..\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a really good device for those who want a cheep tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> There doesn't seem to be much for 4K programs. Hopefully more to come.\n",
      "Positive :-> Size, brightness, and convenience are good. The option to link with android products for messages is a little hard.\n",
      "Positive :-> We have an echo a tap and a dot and love them all.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle voyage is the costliest of the kindle range but its worth it due to light weight and adaptive backlight. Enjoying it so far.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for husband to replace his old one. Uses it all the time and would recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Sound quality excellent, functionality is smooth, App required a day or two for full comprehension. System works beautifully, my sons especially have enjoyed the lighting integration with our LIFX and the Amazon Prime Music requests. Will be expanding the system when \"Dot\" returns.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product! Amazon prime music is at my disposal at allTimes. The skills are sweet. Totally worth the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> Friends of mine have one and said how great it was. I have the amazon fire stick in the house but thought this would be better in my living room. Easy set up.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet for 7 and 2 year old and they are very easy to use. Very durable as they have been dropped a numerous amount of times. No scratches or anything and has many apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great sound quality. Love all the functions that it has.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent tablet!!! works very fast and esay to get apps\n",
      "Positive :-> I enjoy using the tablet. I use it when I am biking.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to Use, Backlight feature is really nice. Like that you can adjust the font sizes and type.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have purchases 2 of the Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) - Black.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is a good started tablet for children.\n",
      "Positive :-> Pretty good Will recommend it to friends and family\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use for my mom and toddler. just like any kind of android device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Useful and fun. Good quality. Good packaging and shipping was easy and fast.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this one as a gift but I DO have a couple I keep for the children to play learning games on. They're awesome.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We're still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond.\n",
      "Positive :-> You can read books as well as browse the internet. It has cameras too.. Good buy and a recommended gift!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet on black Friday and went home to test it out and it was very slow and not worth the money\n",
      "Positive :-> This makes for a great house warming present for anyone who loves tech! Definitely want to buy one for myself.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up. Sound is clear and works well in a medium size room.\n",
      "Positive :-> The 7\" fire tab is a good buy for the money, especially if you got it when it was on sale for 35.00.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to setup, fun to use. Use it daily for music.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for.\n",
      "Positive :-> LOVE IT VERY GOOD IDEM,Front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY\n",
      "Positive :-> I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> There is a lot of bang for you buck in this product. It is not up to par with Apple pads and the high end Samsung pads. Check out the Amazon app store to make sure the app you want to use is available. The screen is adequate, not HD, and outside/full sun hard to read. The operating system is Amazon's version of Android. Audio is adequate. WiFi and Bluetooth work well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Runs Great, very efficient for what we use it for.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is fun and informative...but it does not have the capabilities of Siri. They say it's a work in progress, we shall see. The voice recognition is ok but it does take multiple tries sometimes.\n",
      "Positive :-> To begin with this is the best reader available right now. Brighter than the pw2. Just awesome. Whether or not its a worthwhile upgrade from the paperwhite is another topic. Either way, it's a great piece of hardware- light, good grip, light etc. there is one HUGE issue however! The background light is not uniform- it is tinged yellow towards the top and blue towards the bottom of the device. For a $200 device thats unacceptable! How much that bothers u will be subjective and u wont notice it as much once u get into your book. The problem was present on all 3 devices I purchased (and returned), to the exact same degree. I kept the last one because it still is an awesome reader and it seems like its a production issue. Going through amazon reviews, various online forums- it seems to be present on a large number of devices if not all. Amazon refuses to address the issue, probably because they'll get sued or something for releasing a wonky product, like the iphone antenna problem bottom line- great device, but you have a high risk of receiving a unit with the gradient issue (youtube it if u cant visualize what I'm talking about, tons of videos out there describing it) . How bad it is seems to depend on your personal luck, or which batch your local bestbuy has stock from, and most importantly it will bother you / what youre willing to settle for. In my case, i hated it but there was no alternative- the pw2 seemed like a huge downgrade in a head to head comparison so i decided to keep my voyage and live with it. If thats a problem for you, wait for the 2015 edition. The pw1 had this issue apparently and it was addressed quietly by amazon in the pw2.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use for a beginner. This is my first tablet and I thought I'd have to take advantage of the free setup but I didn't . I love being able to take it with me so I can read while waiting places and not have to carry two books if I'm close to the end of one. I also love the camera. My personal camera was always low on battery power but now I can take my Kindle Fire with me and take photos when ever I want.\n",
      "Positive :-> bought for my grand baby for christmas....haven't opened it yet but the other reviews were great!.....i'' sure he'll love it!!....\n",
      "Positive :-> It was not expensive great for the price I'm happy\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought 2 for each of my children ( 10 & 15) and they love them. I was a little worried about them adapting to a new operating system, no problems there. The sound and playback images are just fine. They take them everywhere, not like leaving their other tablets at home, I'm thinking about buying me one. Very kid durable\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm a big fan of my Amazon Fire Tv. I really enjoy being to access my favor apps on one device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon has a great way of stream-lining their platform, operating system, and design style all within this 1 tablet; great product!\n",
      "Positive :-> I really love the fire TV. I use it all of the time. If I'm not using it my kids are using it. Great for all ages!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is one of the perfect tab for kids, I bought it for my niece and she loved it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Had a Google Nexus which I really liked but started having issues with the power connection. After replacing the USB connector I still had issues with it so I decided to replace it. Did my research and purchased a Kindle Fire and loved it so much I bought two more to give to my parents.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my nine year old daughter and she loves it. Works great for her to watch Netflix and play games and anything she likes doing.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the BEST tablet for the money anywhere on the planet!!\n",
      "Positive :-> We got two of these for our kids. They have put them down. Great price for kids!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to setup and many addons to use.I now use my fire more than my tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love that the tap is rechargeable and portable. Sounds is great! I highly recommend the tap!\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this Echo for my uncle, who is a IT Network Architect and loves everything tech. He has a smart home so he's basically able to carry out everyday tasks with ease (lights on/off, thermostat, grocery list, security system, etc.) He loves that he's able to play his music just by taking to Alexa. I'm so glad I got this for him, he loves it!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it\n",
      "Positive :-> Got as a gift for my mom for Mother's Day . Really great\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased one for myself, then went back bought one for my niece. Then thought how much I love the ease and function of the Kindle got my sister one. I can't say how much I use my Kindle my niece and sister agree best gift I every gave them.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> The product works well 95% or so. There are days the unit seems to get confused or is very slow in responding\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had my Fire for 5 years at least and love it. Bought this for my mother. Her IPad died. She is enjoying it. Her only issue is there is a game she can't download because it is on Google play.\n",
      "Positive :-> I haven't used any other kindle before, but this kindle was made to do its job and it does it properly. It is sleek, lightweight and sturdy. I love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever I go - just in case I get a chance to read. Like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere - you don't need wifi to read. Battery life is great. It has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. The down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. Also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it's light. But I honestly love my kindle, it does it's job and I don't want anything that get's fancier than this.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to read books. Great for night reading. Easy to download books\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought these for our grandchildren they were a hit.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my new reader. It took a while to sort out all of the functions as it is quite different from my old Kindle. Now however it goes with me everywhere. I especially like the back light that makes reading always easy.\n",
      "Positive :-> For an inexpensive Black Friday special, I have to say that I am quite impressed with this tablet. Well worth the $33 price tag. The speakers leave a lot to be desired, but when used with an external speaker, it sounds great. The battery life is also impressive. I've been using it for 2 hours and the battery level is now at 54% remaining. I must admit that I was somewhat hesitant to purchase it, but I figured that for the price, I would give it a try. I am not sorry for my decision. I have another tablet that cost 5 times as much and there is no difference in the performance. Even at the everyday price of $49, this tablet is worth the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> I can finally get back to reading thanks to my new Kindle paperwhite. It's small and lightweight along with a perfect anti-glare reading pane. This is my first e-reader and I love it. The paperwhite is a must as I have no eyestrain as I do when reading on regular computer screens. Intuitive and easy to use!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product! You get exactly what you pay for, plus more.\n",
      "Positive :-> Have had nothing but an amazing experience with it\n",
      "Positive :-> Gave this as a Christmas gift & they loved it. I had to buy a couple more!\n",
      "Positive :-> My wife owns one, so we bought one for my mom who is not tech-savvy, and she seems to be having great success with it so far. Had to buy a case separately because for some reason Best Buy doesn't have any avail in store or even on-line, but the Fire itself is great for light users.\n",
      "Positive :-> You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.\n",
      "Positive :-> This thing is awesome!!! Its very easy to setup and fun to use. The speaker sounds amazing and the microphone is incredible. I wish my siri could understand me as clearly and accurately as Alexa does. I can't wait to expand my whole house automation!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this for a gift for a 75 year old, who is enjoying it as she learns all of the \"amazing things it can do!\" She loves playing solitaire and downloading current books to read before she goes to bed at night. Easy, fun, inexpensive tablet for even the least tech savvy people! :)\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy inexpensive gift that you can rely on. Although i would rather have the Google play store as the main download application, it's Worth the money to buy for others.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet works great but the only down fall is often times it slows down. Other than that great tablet for children at a good price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Product is great. Does a good job at interpreting voice commands. Every once in a while it would have a problem with the wifi connection.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for kids. Easy to use. Great games to download.\n",
      "Positive :-> the back light nad easier to read in all lightings\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my wife for her birthday, and she loves it! It is so easy to operate, and has so much in its library for music!\n",
      "Positive :-> Just bought as a travel companion. Something to watch movies and play games on. So far it has been great. The picture is great. It's really clear.\n",
      "Positive :-> Now I can use my Kindle. Works great\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a fun piece of technology that can link into your home, I.e. Hue and nest and even your refrigerator. Love the capability but she is still limited by what other tech I have in the house. You can even have her order your groceries.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excited to use the Amazon Fire Box. Very easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire TV Brings pretty much every streaming app all under one easy-to-use interface.\n",
      "Positive :-> We cut our cable in hopes to just use this product. However, we cannot view most things without logging into a cable source. So now it just collects dust. I guess if it was \"jail broken\" it might be better.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this item for my daughter and she loves it. Easy to use, beautiful picture, and a great price.\n",
      "Positive :-> We use this for educational purposes for my kids - they love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great device for your transition off cable. I recommend slingtv to help the transition. I have the firetv as well as the firestick. Spend the additional money for better wifi. You can also wire direct for best HD streaming. Netflix and Prime work well over wifi with 20 Mbps type speed. I just upgraded to 100 Mbps for better results. Also see Kodi app.\n",
      "Negative :-> I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for taking on vacation and with memory cards I can take all the pics I want.\n",
      "Positive :-> For a pre-teen, this is what exactly my niece needed. It replaced an old iPad for her. It does almost everything the iPad did. And the price was a lot better.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazing fun getting into the technology age. Connected Echo w Philips Hue lights and Bluetooth speakers. All works great. Wifi consistency a must. Takes getting used to asking a non-human questions!\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Tap is a great mobile Bluetooth speakers, if you are invested in the Amazon eco-system. The produces good sound at all levels, plays music stored in your associated cloud accounts and does everything else the Echo can do, just with mobility added to it (as opposed to the Echo that always has to be plugged into the wall to work).\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my echo. I use it all the time from timer to music. Games are fun grandkids love it also. Great for helping keeping the brain working with some of the games water sound help me fall asleep faster. I got the dot to use in the bed room for water sounds alarm and music. Learn something new all the time with my echo.\n",
      "Positive :-> \"Alexa\" Amazon Echo is the perfect personal assistant. From \"to do\" lists to music, alarms and so much more. I have it on my night stand and the plan was to eventually put it in the kitchen for the family to use, but no!........., she's mine! My wife is so jealous, lol. But seriously, great device, lots of fun and very useful.\n",
      "Positive :-> Exciting for the family entertainment, enjoying all music\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a gift so I don't know much about it. Seems nice though\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the Amazon Paper White Kindle. I can take it anywhere and it's my entire library at my finger tips. I can read at night, in the glaring sun and even in the constant changes of the outdoor light. This is the perfect reader for on the go.\n",
      "Positive :-> I upgraded from the fire stick to the fire TV and man what a difference it made. Way faster a lot smoother and overall just a better experience than the fire stick. Don't get me wrong the stick is affordable and does the job,but if you want faster and smoother transitions from app to app the fire TV is the way to go.\n",
      "Positive :-> For what this is, it's great. My 13 year old loves it. You'll definitely need to get an sd card for additional storage; but for the price, it's so worth it! Would be much happier with her breaking this than an expensive tablet!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a really great product if youre looking to start your smart home.Obviously this works best if you have an amazon prime account, and even better if you subscribe to a few streaming services. You can still stream plenty of free stuff as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Coupled with Wink, this becomes an invaluable tool. I can't comment on audio quality as it's location is not ideal for sound. Voice recognition is the best I have used. Play CNN, Play x, Play y. It works very well. The Smart Home connection is really what I bought Echo for and it is fantastic. Make shopping list and see on your phone. Turn on x light or group of lights. Raise, lower thermostat. It all works very well. If you don't need audio quality, use DOTs. Echo is overkill for my use when DOTs are just as capable. With 6 DOT, 1 Echo and smart 42 devices connected, the home is very smart. Echo and DOTs make it happen. I still use Echo in one location since it was the first part of the system I bought. But now realize DOT would have been fine in that location as well. I recommend Echo if you want a better sound for listening to music, but if you are connecting to your current AV system or are not putting in a location where audio quality is not required, go DOT. Oh and DOTs sound quality is acceptable for communication type audio.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet serves its purpose as my primary reader and mini computer on the go. Size is good, picture is clear, and the volume isn't bad for media either. Thumbs up\n",
      "Positive :-> We recently purchased this as a gift for charity. We chose this because we purchased the same type tablet for our daughter and couldn't be more please. It's very easy set up and super user friendly. I would def. recommend this for a child rather than a more expensive product.\n",
      "Negative :-> Stay away from the certified refurbished Amazon Fire TV. I received two Certified Refurbished defective fire TVs. The first the screen looked half corrupted, see the pictures. The second Certified Refurbished Amazon fire tv I received would not boot up, it was stuck in an infinite loop where I would only see the amazon logo for 10 seconds then it would boot up again.If anything, Amazon needs to re-visit its refurbishment process and quality control of the refurbished products they let get in consumer hands.Update 11/28/16: I purchased a new Fire TV during the BF sale and I have had no issues so far :).\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet, great price, wifi has great range compared to apple products\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product great price wold recommended this great gift\n",
      "Positive :-> great streaming box for watching great movies. amazon tv is fast and fluid to use. they have alot of movies.\n",
      "Positive :-> I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my new kindle. The backlight is a huge improvement over the previous kindle, but it's not an automatic backlit and must be adjusted by the user depending on the situation. If you're looking for an auto backlight, go for the Kindle Voyage.\n",
      "Positive :-> Im very happy with this purchase, i got it on sale for $30 and grabbed 3 lol.Kids luv it\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle was purchased for my daughter. She loves it. She plays games on it everyday.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Fire Tv box is great. Bye bye cable, hello savings. I'm glad I purchased this item.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet for the price and for the kids to use. Can do a lot of the things they like and they can use it for school\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this to replace a nexus player and happily surprised how much smoother this box is. And Comcast allows more apps to be installed on Amazon firetv devices than androidtv devices for some reason, so definitely a plus.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an awesome kindle easy to transport and love the clear screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> Price great for quality and versatility. Bought for son to use for streaming movies and reading books. Great product for him but had to purchase extended memory miniSd card.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the paperwhite so that I could read in the middle of the night without disturbing my husband. It works like a charm, and helps me to fall back asleep faster. The different light settings are fantastic. I really love the dictionary look up feature too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Hello I got this product for my daughter and she loves it. Best Tablet under $50.\n",
      "Positive :-> It was for my 3 year old she loves it!! She was able to work it very easily!!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased these for my boys (7 & 10) to read/listen to books and work on educational apps. Compact and great for use during traveling and away from home. Like the parental options to restrict use during designated hrs.\n",
      "Positive :-> Glad we bought it very informative and smart can answer anything you ask\n",
      "Positive :-> love the item. many features and variety of options. recent and old programs and movies. i can now look at a whole series at once.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the one to get after Amazon's update to have the device always on. It also has the best speaker of the three.\n",
      "Positive :-> I liked this product and its very good for daily use.\n",
      "Positive :-> When I originally wrote this review this remote shipped with the Amazon Echo. Since that time Amazon has made it a separate purchase and dropped the retail price of the Echo by twenty bucks. I purchased my Echo via the Prime invitation for ninety-nine dollars, and at that time it came with this remote, but as stated - it's now only sold as a separate accessory and DOES NOT ship with the current Amazon Echo offered for sale on Amazon for one seventy-nine at the time of this review revision (12/6/15).-----------------------------------This is an excellent accessory for Amazon Echo owners, but please note you cannot pair more than 1 Amazon Echo remote with the Echo at one time.The remote comes with a magnetic cradle which is very handy for storage. (I have my Amazon Echo in my home office, and I store my remote on the magnetic holder which is attached to the side of a wire shelving unit. The remote will not just magnetically attach to metal devices without the holder however.------------------------------------------------What I have found is that using the remote becomes necessary in these scenarios:1. I'm in another room and I want to direct the Amazon Echo to change music or adjust the volume of music that's playing. (Change album, forward to the next song, have the Echo start playing another Amazon playlist from Prime Music, etc...).2. I want to add something to my Shopping List or To Do list when I'm in another room. I pick up the remote and speak into it, having Alexa add those things which then become visible on my list on my smatphone using the Amazon Echo app.3. I want to know the weather before getting out of bed, but the Amazon Echo is in the other room and wouldn't be able to hear me ask.Read more\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Me: Alexa...right this review for me. Alex: Write your own review.Me: I guess Alexa can't do everything...or maybe she just chooses not to. Hmmmmm.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet at a great price! We bought a number of them as raffle prizes for our employee appreciation party and everybody loved them!\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for kids. He has his own tablet, and I can control all access to everything. I don't have to worry about what he's getting into....\n",
      "Positive :-> Everything you want in a tablet. Size is good, price is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Compact, long battery, able to read in any light level.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you have Prime this is the best thing you can buy!\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to install and use. Great for testing whole family. The remote is easy to use and very easy to memorize\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my dad and didn't want to spend a lot since I bought another pricey tablet before for them and works just as good!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased these for my grandsons, ages 5 and 7, they absolutely love them. Able to download apps with ease.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is nice but it lacks a lot of informayion when asking questions. It's not like your smart phone that you can ask anything and will give you the answer. Only to certain thing and you have to email el certain apps in the Alexa app itself to work. Still working on Alexa so maybe that could be the reason but I though it would be like Siri that you can ask anything.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought it as a Christmas gift and the person enjoys it.\n",
      "Positive :-> we brought this tablet for our 6 yr old for Xmas and she loves it!. it was the go to tablet as she was always playing on my fire tablet... recommend for kids\n",
      "Positive :-> Love waking up in the morning & easily getting my calendar & the weather from Alexa. Then I can tell Alexa to play my fav morning radio station. In the evenings, she helps me cook with measurement conversions & we play daily Jeopardy:). And I keep discovering more that we can do with this fun device!\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet is small and a great tool for road trip with the kids. It keeps them entertained and is small enough for them to carry in a small backpack.\n",
      "Positive :-> Who needs a laptop when you can do almost anything with the Kindle Fire?\n",
      "Positive :-> I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it would recommend it .. Works great and takes really good pic\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire TV is so much better than cable or satellite TV. If you have a good internet connection, this is the best!\n",
      "Positive :-> First purchase of an e reader. Kindle Paperwhite is very refined after many generations of change on Kindles. Device is responsive for loading and downloading new books. Backlight is easy to use and adjustable. Our library has over 9000 books compatible with Kindle for checkout. Get the magnetic cover (Kindle brand or OEM) as it turns the device on and off with opening.\n",
      "Positive :-> Pretty cool piece of technology- very smart and fairly easy to use. Definitely recommend as a gift. I haven't fully learned the capabilities yet, but try new things each day. Works really well and she understands everything. Sometimes she talks when you don't say her name, so that can be weird.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a great tablet for a destructive 10 year old. It's still going strong for 2 months now\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my ten year old daughter. This is so much better than carringing around a bunch of heavy books. The battery also lasts forever\n",
      "Positive :-> This has been a great addition to our family...haha! The kids love it. And for the price it can't be beat, maybe by the mini me version the Echo Dot.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect item for my grand-kids and the price was especially just what I needed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased for an 8 year old. Prefers reading books on the tablet vs hard copy and can play games and watch videos. Well worth the $50 cost\n",
      "Positive :-> There's no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there's no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it's just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading\n",
      "Positive :-> If you don't have an echo or never played with one, you will be in for a treat. Words can't describe how much I love this thing. It controls home automated devices, finds information such as recipes, can do shopping for you, find reviews on products, play music, tell jokes, and so much more. I want one for every room. Now it will do phone calls and voice texting to people who have Alexa devices. The phone call on my weak internet was flawless.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great little device it reacts fast to the remote and is faster than the fire stick, if you thinking about getting one get the fire TV instead of the stick.\n",
      "Positive :-> Cheap tablet, bought as a secret santa gift exchange item. My cousin opened it on Christmas and absoluitely loved it. Simple and easy to use, not as fast as an Ipad, but still serves in purpose for simple web browsing.\n",
      "Positive :-> i can't ask for this tablet to more than what its supposed, good starter for kids before they get an iPad :)\n",
      "Positive :-> We can do many things with this Fire. All best entertainment that our family can have from it. Amazon products is better and better day by day!!! Keep it up like that.\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely positively Love my Kindle Fire! It is the best of both worlds being a Kindle & a Inexspensive Tablet!\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a great tablet, not to expensive. Great for kids!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great gift for a kid to read, surf and play music!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought my first Kindle Fire several years ago. This year I bought 3 (a new one for everyone in my household). Great tablet, lightweight & I love that the newer Kindle has expandable memory.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought as a gift but have one as well...love it! Great price!\n",
      "Positive :-> Got as a Christmas gift for my aunt and she loves it would highly recommend she thought she would just use it for books but now she is even using it for games and apps\n",
      "Positive :-> I've always been a fan of gadgets,and I had to have it.I had read some of the reviews that were quite favorable, but I had to find out for myself.I absolutely love it. The sound is rich and room filling. In fact, the sound in bigger than its very discreet size.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this kindle fire because it was on sale. After I took it home i realized I would have bought it at full price. This is a great ereader that you can also use to browse the web. My son loves using this to read his Ebooks and play his games.\n",
      "Positive :-> love this product everyone needs one of these , listen to favorite music use it as a timer in the kitchen ask it a question and get your answers\n",
      "Positive :-> We are enjoying our TV with the surround system. The picture is great as you can see detail's in people and back ground we didn't notices before. We need to get a new dish receiver to move the TV to its new location were we will be wireless.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 3 more of these for family and they love them.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account.\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love my amazon echo. It is very convenient and handy.\n",
      "Positive :-> After being really hesitant on switching from hard copy books to a kindle I decided to go for it. Ever since I've used it I have loved it simplicity and how adapting it can be to light. Still love paper copied books, but kindle versions are much simpler.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. This is my 2nd one. My first one was stolen. It is very user friendly.\n",
      "Positive :-> I own a Kindle HD and completely love it! But when trying to read in areas with a lot of light I kept getting a glare. With the paperwhite I have no more glare. Awesome!\n",
      "Positive :-> It helps me keep my schedule, and Perfect to listen to music.\n",
      "Positive :-> After reading the reviews, it's an awesome gadget added to the collection!\n",
      "Positive :-> Good technology. Does not follow command sometimes.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it. Makes home automation a breeze. Easy setup\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is great to use; her recognition is good, and if you have Spotify and Pandora accounts you can really get a lot out of it (and light / outlet kits: saying \"Alexa, turn on the living room\" feels exquisitely dorky). Plus, it's the only way to order the Dot, which is essentially the top of this speaker. After a week with the Echo, I purchased 2 Dots for other rooms. Again, to get the most out of this, you need to own Kindle Books, have a Spotify account, and preferably Audible / Unlimited.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for one of my granddaughters. It was easy for me to get setup and off she went. Kids are too smart these days.\n",
      "Positive :-> This kindle fire is great. The kids love it. They can watch shows and play games. Keeps them entertained.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for reading white and blackScreen is still small\n",
      "Positive :-> So easy to read and very easy on your eyes. Recommended for storing your books.\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves it. Light weight. Good price for a great product. I would purchase another one.\n",
      "Negative :-> Tried to use it for and it's does not work as ebookWhich is why I am not satisfied ..\n",
      "Positive :-> I previously only had the dot until I got this one. This is so much better for listening to music, the weather report .. everything.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas. I set it up and then wrapped it so its ready to play as soon as it is unwrapped.

      "Positive :-> I purchased this for my 85 year old father, who is hard to gift for. So far he seems to enjoy it. I will be adding some additional smart devices to make it more useful (lighting, thermostat, etc.). I've run into a few hiccups - for instance asking driving directions doesn't work. Nothing major though - all in all, it's a good purchase!\n",
      "Positive :-> We love our Amazon Echo so much we went back and bought one for our daughter for this upcoming Christmas! Ordered a dimmer smart switch along with a Samsung smart things hub. This is a awesome device and is always learning. Can't wait to use it more to its full potential.\n",

When shopping at Best Buy, I mentioned to my husband that I might want to try a Kindle....went to another area and, when I returned, the Kindle VOYAGE was in our basket. OK so I though I would give it a try. I LOVE it! So compact, so easy to read my books and turn the pages without swiping or ??? I highly recommend the VOYAGE to existing and pending Kindle readers. So many great features in such a small package!\n",

      "Positive :-> Bought for grandkids for Christmas and they love them!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to use for our seven year old. Will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capabilities and more memory. She had an iPad (lost it) and misses that, but this is the compromise until we see more responsibility in how it's treated. Seems durable thus far.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is our first of its kind to own. It has a lot of entertainment optikns.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had a Nook for several years but did not get good service from Barnesand Noble so I switched to the Amazon Kindle and I am sooooo happy!\n",

      "Positive :-> Bought this for our 6 year old to use instead of spending the big bucks on an Ipad. It has pretty much all the same apps and it is easy for him to navigate around. Parental controls prevent him from downloading anything above his age level.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is as described. It's portable and the speaker is loud.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been enjoying my paperwhite. Like buying booKS and reading free books as an amazon prime membership benefit. I also bout a book that was in pdf format an I was able to read on paperwhite also\n",

      "Positive :-> We have 2 Echo's, one in the living room and the other upstairs. Alexa will not only play whatever music you ask her to, but she will tell you the weather, a joke, is a timer, an alarm clock, keeps a grocery list, will notify someone of your choosing of an emergency at home, is a companion for an elderly person, or even keep a paraplegic company just by using their voice. There are hundreds of Apps that you can download, that enables Alexa to do on your command. We use the Echo everyday and have listened to our favorite songs from our past as well as current hits and/or radio stations. She has become a welcome addition to our home. Buy one, you won't regret it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a great replacement for my previous Kindle, which is more than 5 years old. However, I liked my old Kindle well enough, and I couldn't justify an upgrade considering the more than $100 price tag. That's why I waited for a one-day sale to pick up the Paperwhite.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased for my son. He really likes it. It does everything I want it to do without offering too much access. The option to lock it down for a certain amount of time each day is something my wife and I love, so he doesn't overuse technology in lieu of other activities.\n",

      "Positive :-> The Kindle Paperwhite is reliable, holds a charge for weeks, is lightweight and easy to hold, allows you to read in bed at night without eye strain or bothering anyone (because of the backlit surface), and stores hundreds of books. What can I say? I love my Kindle, and this one was the second I have bought...this one as a gift for an elderly parent. She loves it! The font is easy to adjust for people who need large print. I take my Kindle everywhere so I am never bored whether I am waiting in the doctor's office or stuck in an airport overseas..\n",

      "Positive :-> Grandma loves it..plays her games and keeps up with the grandkids.\n",

      "Positive :-> Use Echo for so much,music,alarm clock and lights.\n",
      "Positive :->  \n",
      "Positive :-> Good Average device for internet content but for 4K forget about it, but if your looking for a simple HD content is good enough.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very nice display and high resolution! A pleasure to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> I ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful! I'm totally happy with my purchase!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this amazon echo , answers questions, plays my music , even manages lights in the house ! Love it !\n",
      "Positive :-> When I first got echo for my wife and I, we really didn't have the highest expectations. It was really something we got to entertain guests. Now that we've had it for a few months, we've found so many uses for it. Turns on lights when we come home, ensures doors are locked before bed, controls the temp in the home, plays music. We love it\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Echos. I'm a 75 year old widow and I have 2 Echos and 3 Dots in various rooms. I can listen to audio books in the kitchen when I'm cooking and eating or in the laundry room. I play Jeopardy and listen to Country and Western music. At night when I'm trying to doze off, I tell Alexa to play music to help me relax and go to sleep. I tell her to wake me up at a certain time and then I ask what's on my calendar for that day.\n",
      "Positive :-> We love this device. I have the Echo, Echo Tap and the Echo Dot. As the updates arrive, each of the devices just get better and more useful. I love the AI easy access and versatility.\n",
      "Positive :-> Pro's: many. You can integrate and use easily with Spotify, Sirius, and Wink just to name a few. Great for news and weather too. Con's: For the privacy conscious, this is not your best friend as it listens for everything just to catch the word Alexa and the following command. For example, if you mention in a conversation the word \"alexa\" it will do whatever comes after.\n",
      "Positive :-> My sales person was excellent. She knew the product and was able to answer all of my questions. I bought a kindle paperwhite. I had the geek squad to synk it to my laptop. \"I love those guys\"\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased the 8 inch Fire tablet during Black Friday and have been using it since. A great deal.\n",
      "Positive :-> We have joined the modern world and now have access to more viewing opportunities than we imagined. The best part is that this technology allows us to speak our request.\n",
      "Positive :-> Sharp screen that's not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores.\n",
      "Negative :-> System loads slow, but otherwise is ok. Be aware that you are not buying a full tablet. It was what I was looking for!\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +.\n",
      "Positive :-> It has a lot of potential that I haven't tapped into yet but it's met my expectations so far.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son and he absolutely loves it, he continues to enjoy reading while at home or traveling!\n",

      "Positive :-> Super useful for my handicapped parents to control lights, answer questions, reminders, and timers!\n",

      "Positive :-> Works good and great price, great for books or music on the go\n",
      "Positive :-> Great gift for someone who has everything! Very entertaining\n",
      "Positive :-> Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> Must have if you like to read on a tablet. Easy to carry and read.\n",
      "Positive :-> The way Amazon has set up their software is pretty great, they make it easy to get connected to your hulu, hbogo, netflix or whatever streaming service you have. Plus if you are a prime member you are already loaded with streaming content straight from the box, I have two Fire tvs and three firesticks, wouldn't change them for anything.\n",
      "Positive :-> great- easy to set up- great gift item- small and fits in purse!\n",
      "Positive :-> So much faster then the stick. Worth the extra money\n",
      "Positive :-> More interaction is needed between other devices. Too hard to remember opening statements to get echo to respond.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is really the best one on the market. I was lucky to get such a good price at Best Buy! Thanks!\n",
      "Positive :-> Brought this for my daughter she loves it. Really like that she can make her own profile for all her pbs kids and Disney jr apps.\n",

      "Positive :-> This tablet is wonderful and a great value. It's performance is fast\n",

      "Positive :-> Had the older model that didn't light up... Was always having to get to a lamp. Now I can read anywhere without any worries. The light adjusts as needed. I get lost in my book without any worries. The screen is perfect size with great clarity and easy to travel with.\n",
      "Positive :-> I debated for over a year about getting a Kindle. After trying to read my tablet outside this summer with sunglasses and sitting under an umbrella...I finally bought my Kindle Paperwhite. I couldn't be happier and I've read more books in the past couple of months then I have in years. It's as good as they say and easy to read in ANY light!\n",

      "Positive :-> I am able to watch anything I want with the fire stick and it is so easy to use... I love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> I really do use my Amazon ECHO for all my alarm needs. I also do some cooking which needs a reminder when things are done or need to be added for the receipt.\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet was a great price i have recently brought expensive tablets but this one does the same job as the others\n",
      "Positive :-> The fire works fine it's not the fastest but for basic browsing and watching videos it works great. You can't beat it for the price. Great for kids and not having to worry about them breaking it.\n",
      "Positive :-> The ECHO was easy to set up. It also was easy to learn how to use. It was a gift for my wife and she loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle paperwhites are amazing. They are so simple and non distracting. They are very pleasing to the eyes and not having to recharge it every night is great. Can't wait to take it on vacation and read in the sunshine without getting a headache from the reflection of my tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the fact that is very practical and I didn't have to spend a lot of money.\n",
      "Positive :-> And never talks back. This is the best product out there to demonstrate just what technology can do for the average person, and it is constantly updated.every home should have one!\n",
      "Positive :-> I returned one of my cable boxes and just use my AMZN fire. I love that I can use the voice command. Super easy set up.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great basic features - e-mail, web access, etc. Highly portable\n",
      "Positive :-> I read many of the reviews about this tablet prior to purchasing it and was so glad that I did. It's a great tablet.Simple to use at a price that can't be beat. The item arrived in the promised timeframe and in good condition. Very happy with this purchase and will buy more for gift giving!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for someone who reads a lot, though the battery could use a little upgrading to make it last longer for voracious readers like me. I read A TON so it doesn't last very long. Other than that, I'm very pleased with the purchase and the way the salesperson (can't remember her name) handled everything for me.\n",

      "Positive :-> Easy to use and install Love it I get to stream almost everything\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle Voyage is the best e-reader experience available. Text is super-sharp, it's comfortable to hold, the built-in self-adjusting light is awesome, and you change the page by either swiping with your finger or pushing down on the bezel. Unfortunately, all those great features come at a $199 price that is $80 more than Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite and more than double the cost of the company's entry level reader, both of which are excellent in their own right. So five stars for the device itself and minus one star for the high price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Echo is the best voice command device for everyone in the family\n",
      "Positive :-> HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU GOT HOME FROM THE GROCERY STORE TO FIND OUT YOU FORGOT SOMETHING. THANKS TO ALEXA THAT DOESNT HAPPEN ANYMORE. NO PAPER LIST TO LOSE, NOT INTERUPTING WHAT YOUR DOING TO WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU NEED. JUST TELL ALEXA TO ADD IT TO YOUR LIST. NOT TO MENTION EVERYTHING ELSE SHE DOES.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great its the box that will save me money. A must buy\n",
      "Positive :-> MThere are so many cool features and it's really easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> We had a Netgear streaming device for years which was adequate until the remote quit functioning. After checking it out online and visiting the store I felt comfortable purchasing this device. It was easy to setup and get online. It is amazing how much faster, better and smoother our streaming has been. The built in apps are good and there were many more (free) apps that I found and installed without a problem. Some that I installed required that I have a cable TV subscription and so I had to \"log in\" to get them functional but not a big deal. The unit itself is not cheap in appearance nor in quality. It has a nice weight to it and feels substantially durable. The remote is great and the Android App is even better. My local Best Buy store had enough in stock and no hassles. We love our Amazon Fire TV!\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire Tablets are great for the price . My kids ages 10 and 12 love the tablets. The tablets are fast and clear.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product... very reliable under various conditions garage/shed etc.\n",

      "Positive :-> Love my Alexa . Very responsive and technologically advanced product.\n",
      "Positive :-> My husband loves it. He is definitely reading more since he got it!\n",
      "Neutral :-> Gift for my mom, easy to use with her limited technology skills. Answers are limited. Could not identify closest showing of a movie to our house for an example.\n",

      "Positive :-> was a great purchase. loved the color and the camera feature\n",

      "Positive :-> Pretty good tablet, especially if you have prime...\n",
      "Positive :-> My first attempt at kindle. It is nice. Not a very quick processor but gets the job done\n",

      "Positive :-> Great iream i use it kodi and runs great easy to install.\n",
      "Positive :-> I upgraded from the fire stick to this. The fire tv runs much faster than my fire stick. Great product.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you are all in on Amazon, this is the tablet for you. If you don't care about all the bells and whistles, and don't need the latest and greatest tech its a great tablet. We purchased one for my dad (60+) and he enjoys it for his web surfing and facebooking. The screen could be bigger, but for the $30 bucks we paid for it, its hard to complain.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product, fast shipping, for electronics bestbuy is number one.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've been contemplating on expanding into a smart home for quite some time, and getting the Echo was a great first step. I hope to get pretty good at it's functions. It's easy to use, recognizes my voice very well and pretty much does what I ask.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is really the best streaming device it has all the services like netflix, hulu, and it also plays games. I love this fire tv. Its also 4k.\n",
      "Positive :-> I need more learning but I'm coming along.Sirii is better. Music is great on the echo.\n",
      "Positive :-> Unit is nifty for some functions, it would be good with a prime membership. I expect a little more usable content without additional purchase for the price tag. Still have not fully explored the unit.\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves the tablet. I like that Amazon give you free unlimited downloads for two years\n",
      "Positive :-> After years of not reading books, after the Kindle I read daily, the adjustable type size is a big help for old folks like myself :)\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought this for our 3 year old because she enjoys playing games on my IPad. This is a much cheaper alternative should she drop it. Android apps so she can get most of the same games and apps. Timer apps available so I haven't checked to see if you can limit time on the device itself. Bonus is the size, it is perfect for her.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is very easy to set up and super easy to use. I am amazed at the songs that I can ask Alexa to play! I am thrilled with my Echo!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Sorry, nothing comes to mind at this time. I like the product...\n",
      "Positive :-> programming Echo is time consuming, I still have not gotten everything programmed that I would like. We don't use it as much as I thought we would either.\n",
      "Positive :-> So far the Amazon Echo has been great especially at the discounted price. I'm still trying things with the Echo and I also have the Google Home and so far I'm giving the edge to the Amazon Echo as it looks like they have a head start on features.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value!\n",
      "Positive :-> This paperwhite works well. It is easy to use. I would recommend. It is lighter than the fire I was using to read books on.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well and does what it's supposed to do when it's supposed to do it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device. Easy to use and great in sunlight. Easy to add to library.\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love this tablet. I check my e-mail. I watch movies. The only thing I DO NOT like about the tablet is that it sometimes have problems taking you to the correct site. But you must remember that it is a tablet, NOT an computer. I find all in all the picture is clear and the sound is wonderful also it has unlimited cloud storage which is good and when you download a picture it takes just a few minutes. Amazon Prime is a must however or you will be spending a lot of money to view movies and read books as almost everything available cost money. Prime is a money saver and it lasts a full year. It also comes with free shipping. I tried it and it is good. I receive my purchases in 2 days. Prime is the way to go if you purchase this tablet because it comes with a lot of perks.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the kindle out of sadness at first to conform to the non book life, but can honestly say I'm glad I did. My book reading has gone up 80% easily and this compact guy has made all the difference. Easy to use, easy to store, light to hold, doesn't bother my eyes, just magnificent. I would suggest this to anyone, I found the back light better on the eyes than the paperwhite and the battery is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased it to watch/stream movies and tv shows on Amazon. Wish I would had bought the 4K fire stick. This is still a good stick!\n",
      "Positive :-> Not many things she doesn't know. Got echo as gift for Christmas.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great little tablet for the price, It does everything I need it to do. It has tons of apps, easy to set up and use.\n",
      "Positive :-> my wife bought this for herself and loves it. has had it for two months\n",
      "Positive :-> You can't get much better than this for the price. My only critique is that they might as well have not included the camera because it's useless, but if you're using a tablet for the camera than that is already an issue. Good quality resolution, fast for internet browsing, expandable memory. Lots of positives to be found here.\n",
      "Positive :-> There is I could say about this tab but nothing other reviewers haven't said. This tab is AWESOME!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my toddler to keep her busy on road trips or at appointments and she wasn't too fond of it. It's kinda slow and limited to what you can do. One feature I did like is that you can set a profile for kids and they'll only be able to use apps that you designate for them to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Pros:-Fast-nice looking interface-good design-great voice search-good amount of most useful appsCons:-It can get tedious to scroll all the way to right to find the app you want.-They have many of the \"main\" apps but they're still missing quite a few apps that are available on other set-top boxes (Cinemax, Vudu, apps offering 4K content, etc.)-They don't have enough games considering they make the gaming aspect one of their main points of advertising.- Only 8GB of space and you can't use the MicroSD card as extended storage until they upgrade to Marshmallow.- Very Amazon-centricPlease be aware that you cannot play many of the games you can play on your Fire tablet or even your Android phone with Amazon appstore on the Fire TV.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got the most bang for the buck with this tablet. I would've given it 5 stars if it had Google play on it. Otherwise, it was quick with some of the apps that I downloaded on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> For adults or children, the Amazon \"fire\" tablet is impeccable. It has pertness control for parents with young children. If you have a Amazon account, it syncs right to it. Overall, flawless.\n",
      "Positive :-> Streaming quality is great and nicely organizes media from Netflix, Hulu etc\n",
      "Positive :-> I take it everywhere I go. It's got me back into reading again all the time. If you're a first-time kindle buyer like me, you'll enjoy this product. There are problems with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire 7 Tablet allows you to get a lot of free apps. It runs fast even with the amount of apps you have on there.\n",
      "Positive :-> **Purchased the Amazon - Fire - 7' Tablet because it was available for $10 off the regular price.....I needed a tablet that was inexpensive and reliable and found the Amazon Tablet to be a great option....\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a great tool for family entertainment. Lots of things to explore.\n",
      "Negative :-> My view comes from being only a IPad user. And my purchase purpose was for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my Ipad to watch YouTube cartoons, and she operates it very well.I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm returning this in less than 24 hours. So I didn't give this much of a chance. First it seems it REALLY wants you to sign up for Amazon Free Time ($4.99 month). Guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if I did that.So created the child profile on the tablet, moved the YouTube app to the profile. Opened the app and got selections for Popular, Music, Movies etc... Could not locate a \"search\" feature. After repeated tapping, got Music to open. Only to get a warning that \"this content is restricted in the Amazon Free Time app\". What? So I have to join to unlock YouTube? I'm technically savy so the fact that I was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. Maybe there was another way around this but I didn't look. Should not have to.Couple this with the random ads for games, Amazon Prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me. So going back to get a Windows tablet where you click on the YouTube app you get what you are expecting without restrictions. For the $49.99 price I had to try this. But not for me.\n",
      "Positive :-> Like always a timely delivery. We have had these items before and we re purchased\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases\n",
      "Positive :-> We wanted a tablet to take pictures and to access the internet. This product does both well.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have to admit that I am very pleased with my Echo. It was easy to connect to my Amazon Prime account so we have been enjoying music around the kitchen. It is amazingly easy to use. The speaker is great and we are finding it much more than the gimmick I thought it would be. We have enjoyed it so much that we added two Dots, one for each floor.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this tablet. Works great for my needs. Ebooks Facebook light gaming. Internet is a little slow but it's $40 what can I say. I installed Google chrome for more apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like to read and the kindle is great. It's easy to carry with you. You can buy affordable books. I also like the fact you can access the internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I think this is one of the coolest devices on the market. Things I like the most is that you can control all of your smart home devices with the echo.\n",
      "Positive :-> Much better than the fire stick has a lot of memory and processor so it's very fast between menus. most likely will buy another one for another TV\n",
      "Positive :-> They are making updates to the unit but its currently in a good spot. The main issue currently is you cant hear netflix surround mode without cracking. You must change the audio settings in Netflix to stereo mode. Amazon is aware and they should fix it by the end of the November. Scrolling through the menus is quick. I bought 3 total as I have cut the cable at my house. I bought an OFF-Air Antenna and placed it inside ht my attic. I used Sling ($20.00) a month and you get the main channels we watched . (CNN /A&E/History/TNT and others) and Netflix. If your a Prime member you get more movies to watch also.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is ok to be a \"android\" tablet with such a low price. But the display is not good as they described.It hurts my eyes after long use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She was able to use it within minutes. She loves bed it, plays games on it everyday as well as we bought apps to read to her. She loves it all.\n",
      "Positive :-> impulse purchase but a good one. good fit with amazon account that we already had. nice screen, easy to navigate\n",
      "Positive :-> Decent performance but sometime do lag a bit, screen resolution is a bit low for someone coming from a Galaxy S6 and Note 7. But for $33 (got on a sale) you can't expect top end product. Installed Google Play Store without needing root, so I can share my normal adroid app even though this is running fire OS\n",
      "Positive :-> Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this tablet for my dad for Christmas and actually liked it. Didn't know if it would operate at a decent speed with the low ram but it was sufficient for what he used it for.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the Kindle fire to replace my iPad that stopped working. It is so much easier to use and lighter than an iPad. I wish I had purchased one years ago.\n",
      "Positive :-> The scene is flawless and is fast when looking stuff up\n",
      "Positive :-> As everyone else has stated. Easy to read with outside. Great for under the umbrella on the beach also.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it!!! This product has been awesome for my 8 year old\n",
      "Positive :-> It's just ok. Will work but not what I wantedTo controlled by Amazon\n",
      "Positive :-> Very happy with my product. Best Buy staff was extremely helpful\n",
      "Positive :-> Really like this allows me to set reminders and listen to Sirius radio. Easy to set up\n",
      "Positive :-> My Alexa doesn't recognize Agoura hills. Does not play free music. How can I get those to work\n",
      "Positive :-> What can I say,I love my Kindle! Has the right amount of light and very versatile to read..\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased one for my older son last year....Got this second d one for the younger one so they don't fight over them.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet for my grandkids ages 2 and 4. They love it! It's easy and fun to use for toddlers. It's perfect for the educational games they enjoy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Well my kids love them. So that's great for me. The only bad thing I can say is i can't figure out how to make it so they can download free games and not ones that cost money.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's great for reading in bed or anywhere for that matter.\n",
      "Positive :-> Absolutely love this tablet. This is the second one we have purchased for our 1.5 year old. Our 3 year old has one as well\n",
      "Positive :-> I really enjoy the kindle fire.It is easy to use and fast.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire is an excellent choice and cost effective, havent had any troubles, it works perfect!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a very good tablet which has power CPU and lots of features. I glad I purchased it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am not a \"techie\" but I love the Kindle Fire. It is easy to use and of high quality. It is an amazing value compared to other readers.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect size and readability and function for pages turning is comfortable\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids love this tablet! Good for those long road trips.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for children to enjoy for a low price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Gave the Kindle Paperwhite as a gift to my daughter for her birthday and she loves it! Great battery life.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is extremely handy and easy to use. The library of books available on Amazon is extensive. The ability to have a device that can hold hundred of book in the palm of your hand is unparalleled.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kids load them with moves and used them for long car rides\n",
      "Positive :-> My grandkids plays with this tablet all the time.lots of videos and games\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up. LOTS of free tv with this. If you're an occasional TV watcher and pay for cable or Sat service, you just be able to ditch them and put the $ towards something else.\n",
      "Positive :-> It was so easy to setup and to use, I would buy this for a gift\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this to watch PlayStation Vue which it does very well. It is relatively small and does to make any noise that I can detect.\n",
      "Positive :-> fits my needs, love to read and it just fits my hands and is great and easy to read\n",
      "Positive :-> gave up old tablet due to battery issues apps take getting used to but nice tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> completely satisfied, and absolutely love it!!! definitely a great thing to have...\n",
      "Positive :-> Pretty much this is worth it just to have Alexa play anything from Prime Music. My kids love talking to Alexa (once she understand them) and I use the timer function all the time while cooking. Only keeps one shopping list and one to-do list but its great to just say something and have it added to a list. Alexa is great for the capabilities she has, but the skills are limited so far so I recommend looking into capabilities or plan on programming your own. For example, she doesn't come out of the box able to read your email even though she can access google calendar. She is also not proactive, such as notifying you of a phone call or email. But overall, fun add-on if you are in the market for a speaker.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a excellent item for kids. And better then spending 100+ for another tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Crazy that you have to buy these separate for some kindle products that should come with one\n",
      "Positive :-> I have really enjoyed this purchase in the month that I have had it. It is very versatile, responds to many voice commands, makes additions to my calendar - and it has a great speaker. I recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 5 year old son loves his kindle. He can fully work it himself. We love all the he age appropriate games, learning apps, and books. The case is great for all those accidentally drops.\n",
      "Positive :-> I always wanted one of those, but they were too expensive compared to a tablet. But now I am loving it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Really like this device helpful and fun. We like the accurate data and the fun skills. Can't wait to connect our lights\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire TV works great. Picture and streaming is fantastic.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up for use and to add skills to personalize Alexa for you own use. Turn on lights, get the news, sports and weather by asking. A nice addition.\n",
      "Positive :-> Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent bargain and works for all purposes that a tablet is needed for.\n",
      "Positive :-> Have fun with it .Good game Good apps . Easy to used\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for streaming kodi and much faster than firestick\n",
      "Positive :-> I enjoy having this smaller tablet to carry around\n",
      "Positive :-> very happy. tablet or smart tv for bedroom. movies,news,games and web browsing. great picture and good sound. best product for price.\n",
      "Positive :-> it's wonderful. I love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books.\n",
      "Positive :-> this is my fifth kindle i have bought. I love them.\n",
      "Positive :-> perfect christmas gift for my mother in law. easy to use and great for reading anywhere. she loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice lightweight reader. Very thin and so easy to use and navigate! Love it\n",
      "Positive :-> I use it mainly when I am traveling to read books, watch movies, listen to music, play games and check email. Works very well and does everything that I need.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great, but don't like how you have to spell everything out.\n",
      "Positive :-> From the small design, this unit packs big power. Although the newer model has an external memory port for sd cards that make this even better, the amount of endless apps, and movie choices(if you have prime) makes this essential. You can still order shows and movies without prime, and many apps are free. I would recommend the newer model and at least a 32gb sd card for heavy users, or if kids will be using it to download apps, as the internal memory runs out pretty quick.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I'm so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can't go wrong with this purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a very compact Kindle; great for reading your favorite novels on the go!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the second fire tablet I have purchased. I purchased one a year ago for myself and bought the second for my wife. She loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love this kindle fire. It has so many nice options and is small enough to carry when I go out! Great for games and emails.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you are looking for a reader that is just a bit more than a reader this is the right product. I bought this for my wife so she would stop trying to read on her small phone, and she absolutely loves it. Battery life is good, build quality is great, for the price there is really no comparison.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good product for books only. The apps and other things are not like an iPad. Very clunky, slow......However, the kindle is better than an iPad for book reading. It is lighter, the interface with Amazon is seamless and you can say download a sample of 40 pages for free before deciding to buy it, which is a huge plus !!\n",
      "Positive :-> this box is definitely better than the fire stick. if you have amazon prime and Netflix you don't really need cable with this box.\n",
      "Positive :-> I brought the tablet for my 9 year old son it's great for the kids can play lots of games download apps get on you tube ect but I don't like the fact every now and then it makes this weird sound and the screen blanks out and I have to turn the tablet off in order for it to work again.\n",
      "Positive :-> Cannot beat the price. Beautiful screen, durable materials. Extra bonus for prime users is Amazon Prime music and video library. Fits a great niche for ultra-portable needs. For music, I pare it with my Oonz portable speaker for great sound.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the second Kindle Paperwhite we have purchased for one of our Grand Children. This is a great tool to promote reading for kids or adults. This tool combined with Amazon's available online subscriptions or purchasing books individually is the way to go.\n",
      "Positive :-> very thin and portable.. If i've read more i would use it\n",
      "Neutral :-> it's just ok for a tablet, it doesn't have google play store of course which limits a wide variety. I would think by now they would offer most of the play store apps but nope. It's slow and browser doesn't load pages with flash or graphics good. poor camera. but it functions ok for a cheap tablet. i didn't expect a lot, but did expect better from kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've owned a fire stick, chromecast, Apple TV and Roku, This is by far my favorite device for cutting cords!\n",
      "Positive :-> I would tell everyone ik to get this. U can format it however u like to. Very easy to understand.\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love this Amazon Fire TV!! It's processor is so much faster than fire stick which I love the stick too. I get to watch so many of my favorite movies and tv shows plus they have so many great apps for anything you want!! I highly recommend this product!\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product to be able to see thousands of free movies if you are a member of Amazon Prime.\n",
      "Neutral :-> It did some things really well, like setting alarms and playing music, but there were too many times I would ask Alexa a question and she would respond saying she didn't know. I ended up returning it. Great promise, I just don't know that it is there yet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. Great performance. Skills take some getting used to but lots of possibilities.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am surprised that they could sell this tablet for so low considering it's quality. It's not the best tablet by a long shot but I haven't had many complaints for the price. The apps and OS run very well; not sluggish like one may think. The screen and sound quality isn't super HD but it's acceptable.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa has become an addition to our family. There isn't one day that we don't ask Alexa to help us out. It's not an intimidating tool. Very user friendly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good battery life, great screen (your eyes won't hurt after hours of reading), easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> Great starter tablet for any one looking to not spend much money.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon has been the leader in this space of voice recognition and with the AWS engine behind it, there's a lot of opportunity for development, both from the community as well as Amazon. Naturally they favor interaction with services they sell, so others will need to build links to others, but the development environment seems to support a lot of innovation already. The price of this TAP was outstanding, adding it to my existing ECHO and now considering a DOT.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my Kindle Voyage. The size is much smaller than my older Kindle and the weight is much less. This helps as I take fm Kindle everywhere. Love the touch screen features.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very useful and fun to use.I bought 2 for the beach house\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use. Does it all. Faster than my other tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fire tv is good for watching prime movies, but great for making a easy Kodi box.\n",
      "Positive :-> I rarely watch live TV so watching my favorite TV programs on the fire TV works better for me. Also great for watching netflix.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had 2 other tablets that worked terrible. It wouldn't even take e-books from the Library! But this is the perfect balance between an e-reader that could get boring to some people, & a tablet, that uses up the battery real quick. And you don't have to connect to a computer to download the e-books either, which is a real convenience!! So I would have to say this cute little tablet is really a lifesaver for a lot of really Poor people, that can't afford to buy expensive electronics. If they lose it, breaks. or gets stolen, they could easily just go buy a brand new one. The goal is to stay connected to the mainstream. It is easy to carry on the bus, bring to the park, maybe a classroom, or library, dining room, coffee shop. And not a big worry about losing a lot of $, if it got lost. Plus, with the \"Amazon Cloud\", You would never lose any of the e-books, that you paid for, & can use on all you devices. This should be considered a Gift-package from Amazon, especially for new people that never had a chance to own their very Tablet, & always have to run to the library, or borrow someone else's. Penny\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this product! My home automation is wonderful to be controlled by voice.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the tablets as Christmas gift for my nieces. Perfect for them ages 9, 7, and 5. They love reading and this is a viable option when traveling. Instead of movies when riding in the car, they read!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for intertainment very good device effective better than cable Tv\n",
      "Positive :-> Never thought I would buy something like this but absolutely love it\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my daughter that is entering 6th grade. Not only is she reading more, but reading more complex books and expanding her vocabulary tremendously with the word \"look up\" feature. Screen is free of glare and looks much like a paper book as the name implies. Great for learning and recreational reading.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kids love playing with it. We use it for netflix and for basic games\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter has a great time reading and researching and playing games on this.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought a bunch of these as gifts. They were a huge hit. The tablet has better functioning than its older versions (which also cost 3x more). I would 100% recommend anyone that wants a tablet for recreational daily uses like searching the web, reading, watching videos, playing games, and checking mail.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids are 18 months and 4 and they love this tablet. It's easy for them to use and very lightweight\n",
      "Positive :-> Love using this for music. Will sometimes have to repeat the command 2 or 3 times before Alexa will understand and then do e command that was given\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought tablet for my dad to use, he is 80 yrs old and has never used a tablet before, he caught on quick. Size was perfect for him to handle.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you want a good e-reader Amazon has a number of options, but some of the newer ones are unexpectedly expensive. This one is great if you want to read any time but not break the bank.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Kindle Paperwhite. I read it every night before I go to bed.If you love to read before bed - I highly recommend the Paperwhite vs. the other Kindles - the others are like computer screens - and it is very stimulating to your brain... this is just like reading paper - except you don't need a light on in the room because it's back lit - but you can adjust the light from fairly bright to very low. Battery lasts 10 to 15 days depending on how much I read.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device fast and big enough to see and easy to use !!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have enjoyed my Kindle Paperwhite very, very much. It is an excellent eReader for me as my eyesight isn't what it used to be and the backlight really helps is keeping the text readable especially in low light situations. It was a wonderful Christmas present from my dear spouse.\n",
      "Positive :-> it wasn't worth my money to be honest but it is good whenever your bored\n",
      "Positive :-> This product does everything. An ipad does at a quarte of the price. Am very pleased. Highly recommend\n",
      "Positive :-> Product works well but has more potential than is currently offered. A bit difficult to set up on households sharing a Prime membership. Lacks flexibility with your I tunes library unless you want to pay Amazon to access the songs you already own. Hopefully Amazon will get smarter. Highly recommend the product.\n",
      "Positive :-> read most of the reviews. didn't see anything about ads or I may have been blinded on how cheap it was. there are ads at the lock screen and the pop ups from free apps. the several apps I have download would always pop up. got me annoyed so I returned it. besides that it is pretty smooth operating, smoother than galaxy tab A.\n",
      "Positive :-> I cannot think of a better e-read than kindle. At first it seems a little bit dark and weird but after a while you will find that you cannot read on ipad or other pads anymore. Kindle is just that good\n",
      "Positive :-> All I have to do is speak, and I have music and news. It keeps me company.\n",

      "Positive :-> im always using my amazon tablet...perfect for games!!!\n",

      "Positive :-> Great product if you are already a heavy Amazon user. Bought one for my parents and they love how they can stream free movies from Prime.\n",
      "Positive :-> My husband wanted the fire box and we are glad we got it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I own a a previous model of the kindle and like that. I thought it couldn't get any better. Them I found this its touch screen and it lights up. So you literally can read it anytime, in the light in the dark. I use it everyday.\n",
      "Negative :-> Bought 2, 1 did not work out of the box. Too slow, too much trouble to setup and requires amazon account to use. Returned both items\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this item for my 1 yr old and at first would not pay attention to it since he loves to run around. But when we are out its a good tablet for a kid and very durable since kids tend to drop toys. We use it to watch movies and even kid educational apps. It's a good buy for the price and to entertain the kids. Video quality is very good.\n",

      "Positive :-> My daughter loves it. Much faster than her last tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased strictly for PS VUE and can confirm it works great including 60FPS and lag-free (almost as good as PS4) guide navigation. It is drastically improved in speed over the 2nd gen fire stick ($40) which had too much navigation lag and capped at 30FPS. The Fire TV is much faster and worth the extra money as it also includes 4K and a gigabit ethernet port. It does lack VUDU and Google Play so not all apps are available and will not likely be available due to Amazon Prime proprietary service. Overall it functions great and is very FAST!\n",
      "Positive :-> Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my son with a 32gb memory. He uses it for school and play.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my husband because he only uses a tablet to read and occasionally look up items he's interested in on the web. It has been perfect for the light use he puts it to. He doesn't have a lot of knowledge about using computers etc. and this allows him to read, play simple games and check out guns and other things he's interested in without having to learn how to use anything more complicated.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great quality great movies the Amazon Fire Stick in the Amazon box is the best thing I ever had\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this as a Christmas present for my exchange student.He loves it.If I was more of an android user I'd consider one myself, especially with the kindle lending library.\n",

      "Positive :-> Wife loves it. She said it opens much faster and likes auto updates for apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this for my kindle and it does what it's intended to do. Quality looks fine as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased the tablet because it was a very reasonable price. It has ended up being a good tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my youngest and he loves it.. very easy to work and fast downloading. Great investment until he wants the real thing..\n",

      "Positive :-> Awesome product. Got two of these for two kids! They really enjoy!\n",

      "Positive :-> It is highly recommended for someone who loves reading. Easy set up, lots of books to download.I have iPad, but this beats reading experience hands down.One downside is that the new Kindle Paperwhite has lower battery life compared to it's previous generation. Hence only 4 star.\n",
      "Positive :-> knowledgeable- courtesy- out of way helpful-professional\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device. Very fast and responsive. Capable of streaming in 4k and while there is limited content, it comes thru beautifully. Alexa and voice search is fantastic.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loved it . Best gift for the price it comes with way more then I could have expected\n",
      "Positive :-> Got these as Christmas presents for some of my family members and I must say they love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's worth the $50. The amazon App Store has a lot of potential. The UI is kinda like android but not as refined. I'm satisfied with the tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy setup and installation and would recommend this product to anyone that's an Amazon Prime member.\n",
      "Negative :-> I got this tablet with high expectations given it's from Amazon. However it was disappointing in many ways and it will be returned.First off, despite of the small screen size, it's heavy. Too heavy to be used as a book reader in bed.The deal breaker for me was that there's no way to connect a VPN using the regular Android settings. The option has been deactivated and accordingly to the tech support, \"it's not available yet, but it will come\". Surprisingly, still according to them, none of the new Amazon tables on sale have such support! Apparently Amazon doesn't believe that open WIFI at coffee shops, supermarkets, airports offer data security risks for the tablet users.On top of that, the Amazon version of \"Google Play Store\" has a reduced number of Apps and the ones I was interested in are not available.And the cherry on the top, was that only after 15 min of small usage (I was still trying to find a way to connect to my VPN), the screen frozen and the tablet became unresponsive.Too bad! I really wanted to like it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This paperwhite is great for reading anywhere ! Outside, at night ! It small lightweight and i just love it !\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids love their amazon kindles! They can take them anywhere and play on them! Great battery life!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet because it was on sale and i had heard it was a good entry level tablet. It is quick on the touch response. Camera is decent but not the best. Its good to view videos.\n",
      "Positive :-> The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix\n",
      "Positive :-> My son has enjoyed using this to read books and stream the internet. The price was great too!\n",
      "Positive :-> I had the old Version of the Kindle and loved it. But now that I have the Paperwhite, i realize what a good decision it was to trade up. The contrast is like reading a real book and it doesn't hurt your eyes to read it for a long time.\n",
      "Positive :-> Small amd neat. Everything you need on this little device.\n",
      "Positive :-> I loved that the kids enjoyed it and I would be getting another one\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the Amazon Tap. The sound is great and it's completely portable. It lacks the convenience of touch free voice command but it cost less to compensate. Excellent product for the money!\n",
      "Positive :-> All data from previous Kindle self loaded and was a seamless transition from old to new unit.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is little slow at start up. But once its up. it works great. For the price, it is a great device. I play basic games, they run smoothly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product!! Love sound quality. Love being able to control Dish Hopper.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great product! Alexa is always available to answer my questions, play my music & control smart devices in my home.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good startup tablet for reading articles online & shop\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is the best I have seen for $50. The screen is very readable which is more than I can say for anything else at this price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Lightweight, seems very durable. Bought so my toddler can use my kindle on a flight in a few weeks.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is great, and I really like it. Especially for kids.\n",
      "Positive :-> not necessary\n",
      "Positive :-> have heard so much about echo ,I had to try it out. Setting up with my router was a little hard but finally got it and when disconects again it back up on its own, nice to ask about weather or what ever and not have to grab my phone need to get prime music account so can listen to any or all music on there but for now really happy glad I got it,good price too.\n",
      "Positive :-> To date, it's working fine. I'm hoping that it continues to work it's usually not the charger that goes bad for me though, it's the cord!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the THIRD power charger that I have HAD to buy at cost of over 30 each since my Kindle Fire purchase. Why can't the chargers last a REASONABLE amount of time When I connected this charger, I received a message saying that it was a LOW level charger it probably would not charge while the Kindle was in use. NOT ACCEPTABLE for this cost!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> What can you say for 30 bucks I got 2 great gifts love them\n",
      "Positive :-> Great music and. Fun to test her knowledge. Amazing how qickly she responds to any question. Cannot stump her.\n",
      "Positive :-> Able to download music and movies free!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> To be honest, I think the Fire TV is a way better investment than Apple TV. Highly recommended!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have bought a lot of tablets for my kids and all have broken. This tablet has lasted the longest and is the most kid friendly.\n",
      "Positive :-> THE PRICE IS AFFORDABLE FOR ANY BUDGET..GREAT OVERALL TABLET\n",
      "Positive :-> Did not have a USB at home that worked with this kindle. This was a must have.\n",
      "Positive :-> Enjoying my Tap, asking Alexa questions, and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, was the difficulty in connecting the Tap to public wifi's such as hotels, in my situation...takes some effort.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the tablet. It works really well. I ended up purchasing two, a black one for my wife and I to use and a blue one for our toddler son. So far so good. I did get free virus software with the tablet as part of a black Friday deal but it doesn't seem compatible with the Amazon Fire although it's supposed to be. Thus far that's the only downside.\n",
      "Positive :-> this item was cheap and good in use. I had no problems with this item.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a gift from my wife. I wanted a lighter Kindle and this is it. I have been happy with this new version.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is not my first kindle. I wanted one I could read outdoors and it is exactly that. Small, but not too small, it fits easily into your hand and it easy to transport. I am satisfied.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great\n",
      "Positive :-> We love  it!! I just need some help and tips on how to work it!!\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a good device for kids and first time smart device users. Easy interface without breaking the bank.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids just Love there tablets and they are Very Much worth the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two of these this year and I love my Fire TV it's very fast and fairly cheap the customer service was great when I bought my Fire TV. I can watch my Amazon Prime Hulu Netflix everything from one box. I will be purchasing one more cuz I love them so much specially when you stream using an ethernet cable which the best. This box is really fast it does not buffer\n",
      "Positive :-> Been lots of fun and for a Star Trek Fan to be able too say Hello Computer and just go from there is making my day. We have two of them now so have one on each side of the house.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works fine and I am pleased with my purchase. I would purchase again.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this item works great and is so useful in the home\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought two. One for a university student, the other for an 11 yr old. No more waiting for books in the mail! Books are immediately downloaded. They are able to run Netflix, Facebook, YouTube, Pandora etc not choppy, immediate loading. TToonnss of apps. Many free. They are surprisingly durable, more than my son's iPad. The battery life is good. Thinking about buying another.\n",
      "Positive :-> My life with Alexa has improved so much. I could ask Alexa questions that I may have and she responds quickly....I even listen to music and I just wonder what life was before ALEXA!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> It does everything I need a table to do. And it is really fast..\n",
      "Positive :-> This kindle has easier viewing and the light adjustment is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> This little box should be call a happy box. Once you have sat it up all you have to do is say what you want and it pop up on your tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love getting weather, trivia and Music all from one sleek source.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is everything it promised. I use it to download books.\n",
      "Positive :-> This this works awesome with my hue light systems. I set up my weather and news to get daily info. The one minor trouble is that you have to make sure you anunciate so it doesn't misinterpret you.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my seven year old. Last year was an iPad and lasted 3 months. I couldn't see spending $300 on another so I settled for this kindle. She loves it and I'd recommend it as a great tablet for the younger kids and at a great price.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Fire is great for our 6 year old to play some games.\n",
      "Positive :-> My children love their tablets plus they were more affordable than kid tablets. I just purchased a child proof case and downloaded the games they play. Totally worth it!\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves this tablet. No complaints. You can't beat the quality at this price\n",
      "Positive :-> Hate Amazon! The app store doesn't have cool apps!\n",
      "Positive :-> Overall I think the Heart S3 in an excellent product. I am still learning how to make the most of it. I need reading glasses to read so if your like me you may want to consider that.\n",
      "Positive :-> Had to purchase another kindle because my current one had reached its memory capacity.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for beginners and senior citizens. Simple to operate.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a very servicable tablet ... an excellent value for the price!\n",
      "Positive :-> This works as advertised...I use it every day.Sounds great...quality made.It's like having another family member.So glad we got it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to setup and connect. Works well with various apps\n",
      "Positive :-> Absolutely love my Echo. In fact, this is our second one...for our second home. Whether you need/want the weather, music, news updates or just have a random question, Echo is the answer. Already have bought two additional Echo's for Christmas gifts.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I purchased this one because I heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black Friday.\n",
      "Positive :-> Recently bought one of the 8GB models for myself and loved it. The next day, I ordered one for my wife and one for our kids. Easy to use, good battery life and a great price!\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon echo was a great choice. Get your money's worth.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it would recommend to a friend .Have fun with family asking questions and great with music.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for reading but also has many other functions. Downloaded my favorite games & travel apps. Set up easy. So far, works great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Small and lightweight. Easy to use! I can read, search the web or check in on social media on this device.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo has simplified so many things- turning on the lights, checking the weather, playing music. I'd hate to think about what life was like before!\n",
      "Positive :-> I had an old (non-backlit) Kindle and loved it. When this one went on sale I bought one for my son (an avid reader like me) and he liked it so much I bought one for my wife next time it went on sale. I was going to get one for myself but the sale ended. I forgot about it, just kept using my old Kindle. Then lo and behold it went on sale again so I ran out and finally got one for myself. Keep in mind my primary use of it is as an e-reader and for that I can't imagine a better device. I can also pop online and check my email etc but I only do that when I'm on a secure WIFI (e.g. at home or a friends; I don't use hotel etc even if there is a 'password' because shared WIFI's are insecure). So for $40 it can't be beat.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like playing the games on it and doing email and music that I can listen too.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo responds to \"Alexa\" and you can ask things like what's the weather tomorrow; scores of your favorite teams; play music from prime; set a timer to alert you; shop for Amazon items. Alexa is constantly learning what your preferences are the more you use it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the device easy to use. It does the job. I can use a regular keyboard too\n",
      "Positive :-> Great little box that does cut the cable streaming. Almost all of those services are on the box and seem to work fine on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Kindle Voyage is the absolute e-reader to end all e-readers. Light, amazing screen, and stylish, minimal design. If you want an e-reader, definitely buy this one!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love Alexa and that lady knows everything. I have even hooked up some more functions to her.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others.\n",
      "Positive :-> goes great for amazon prime users. The user interface is easy to navigate and is awesome for personal use.\n",
      "Positive :-> A must have for your baby or child!! 100% Free apps!!\n",
      "Positive :-> This Amazon Fire TV is my second unit in my home. I haven't paid for cable since I bought my first unit a couple years ago. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you should seriously already own one.\n",
      "Positive :-> If your looking for a great tablet without the high price this is the tablet for you...\n",
      "Positive :-> A fantastic tablet for the price. It's not HD but the display is very sharp and vibrant. A great tablet for kids and teens.\n",
      "Positive :-> My Alexa Echo is so fun and very easy to use. I love asking her questions and having herPlay my favorite tunes.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought the Kindle Fire Kids edition for my daughter. Very easy to install and download several varieties of apps and books and music and photos to customize to her interests. Very well built and easy to use. Compared to several other brands we have purchased this is by far the greater option.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this to replace my original Kindle just to read ebooks, thinking the back light would be a nice feature. I really didn't think I would use the other features but I have found that I really like being able to check my email & surf the web without lugging my laptop around. My wife has a more expensive tablet but my Fire does everything hers does. I love it!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price, works well for what i needed. No need to spend hundreds on other tablets.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an amazing item for the money. Cheaper then my first scientific calculator many years ago.\n",
      "Positive :-> Everyone we know who bought echo has loved it. We are looking forward to learning all it can do! So far so good with ease of use.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Alexa does well with basic applications. Hopefully Amazon will continue to improve on it's ability to answer more in depth questions besides the weather and play music.\n",
      "Positive :-> I wasn't too sure about getting a tablet at first. I've had an iPhone for years and have always loved reading hard cover books. I was also concerned that I would have a hard time learning the software other than apple. I'm happy to report that the software was not difficult to adjust to in the least and I thoroughly enjoy reading on a tablet now!\n",
      "Positive :-> Such a better alternative than cable I am able to watch exactly what I want to watch without having to pay extra\n",
      "Positive :-> old one broke after 9 years, new paper white is great, can read in low light, etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Echo is great. But it is stuck at home. Amazon Tap on the other hand goes everywhere. In the short time we have had ours, we have brought it to Sweden, Portugal, the lake up north and friend's houses. It has served as a music host at card games, answered questions and added things to our shopping list. It is easy to set up Amazon Tap to a wifi network using the Alexa app on your smartphone. You can also easily pair several devices to the Tap via Bluetooth. What really makes this device great is that the cloud based software is continually updated. New skills and capabilities are made available on a regular basis. Amazon really hit home with the Tap as the voice interface is so easy to use, and the portability makes it a great.\n",
      "Positive :-> My wife has used a Kindle Fire for years now and it was time to upgrade her. This device went on sale right before Mother's Day and I knew it was time to upgrade her 3 year old device. I picked a color and ordered and delivery to the store and pickup was just in time for the weekend. Overall, great product and great service from Best Buy for getting it to me in time.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not the first and not the last one I will buy.Love the app to run it on my phone too.\n",
      "Positive :-> You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. If this came with the google play store, I would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Overall it is a great tablet at this price point. I would highly recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> We already have an echo so I didn't think we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it. Now we use it everyday -- mostly to stream Amazon prime, TuneIn, or Pandora channels.It is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings us back to where we were when I was a kid -- having a \"beat box\" to carry around room to room and outside. We use the tap as a 2016 version of a \"beat box\" that is much smaller, rechargeable, and way easier to tune! And with side benefits of controlling our lights, HVAC, and with Alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia questions.The sound quality could be a bit better, but surprisingly good. Adjusting the volume isn't as easy as it should be. The battery lasts a long time and its a snap to use a bluetooth speaker as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> A good product with annoying limitations like limited knowledge about things. It does not always access my music on command although the music is in Prime music\n",
      "Positive :-> This is one of the most amazing products. We have several of these throughout our house - Kitchen, Living room, our master bathroom, bedrooms, etc. We use it all the time to play music from XM, Pandora, Amazon music, etc. We play specific songs on demand. We get news and sports updates. We get info from Wikipedia! We play games - Jeopardy! We order Pizza from Dominoes! Check my commute time! Make a grocery list a To-do list! Use it as a timer! Use it as an intercom in the house with other Echos. How did we ever live without it! I highly recommend! The voice recognition is great! Way better than Apple Siri! You should buy one - you'll love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Highly impressed with my purchase. Allows me to use my iPad again since my 3 years old granddaughter finally has her own tablet. Great support and numerous educational apps for children!\n",
      "Positive :-> What can I say, for 50 dollars this tablet surprised me. I did buy it during Black Friday when it was on sale, yet still worth the 50(regular price). It may not have the best screen resolution nor screen size yet it runs smooth. I have been able to watch Netflix and play games on it with no problem. Plus your able to expand the storage up to a 128gb that is crazy. This is going to be my travel tablet and I did buy a second one for my cousin for Christmas. I think overall for 50 dollars you can't complain and am very happy with the purchase made.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got the kindle fire hd8 for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it very much\n",
      "Positive :-> I have the Fire Stick and added the Fire TV. The Fire TV is noticeable faster than the Fire Stick and more reliable. If you like the Amazon interface, which I do, go for the speed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet, light, small and inexpensive for entry level consumers that have an Amazon Prime account. Combined with the amazon free content to prime members (books,movies,games) and amazon underground, this tablet is on fire! Plus easy on the wallet should something bad happens to it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not enough free programs. Even with a subscription to Netflix, etc. you still have to pay for most movies, shows.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was hesitant to buy this before but now feel that I made the right choice. Alexa syncs well will spotify and smart bulbs.Apart from listening music and too lazy to switch on/off lights, i can get an update about nearby traffic, weather before even getting out of the bed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love listening the music. Great to be able to get my weather forecast for the day!\n",
      "Positive :-> If you are an Amazon prime member then amazon fire with Alexa is a no-brainer. No need to subscribe to cable tv when amazon fire has all the movies and apps you need. Try it and you will be hooked.\n",

      "Positive :-> This unit can tell you past, present and some future things and in an instant too!\n",

      "Positive :-> It's my second Kindle but it didn't come with any instructions so it's taking a little while to figure out. The back lighting is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Echo is their response to Siri in stereo. It has terrific voice recognition and constantly learns new things. The only shortcoming is that it doesn't play nicely with iTunes.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this thinking it would be a cheaper tablet for my son with great graphics. It is exactly that.\n",
      "Positive :-> This makes three I have purchased. This time as a gift. Its fun, accurate and works.\n",

      "Positive :-> You will very quickly learn how to talk to her in a way that she will understand and it's not unlike speaking to a small frustrating toddler. Alexa, when was George Washington born? George Washington was born...blah blah Alexa stop. There were rumors his teeth were wood but these turned out to be false, ALEXA stop speaking! There will be many times she will not understand what you're saying which can be both frustrating and hilarious. Alexa, put tomatoes on my shopping list. I've put potatoes onto your shopping list....Well, guess I'm eatin potatoes. That said, now that I've learned how to speak to the Echo it usually does exactly what I want it to do. I think the echo is well worth the price\n",
      "Positive :-> My Hulu plays perfectly..great volume. Kindle starts right up so I'm able to read fine. However, when I'm on Facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. Sometimes Facebook app won't even load. I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven't dropped it so I'm assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need \"the Amazon app\" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR. I wish I could replace for a new one.\n",
      "Positive :-> When I just want to read, the Kindle Paperwhite is everything I need. It does not strain my eyes, so I can read longer if I want. The front lit screen is perfect in dim light.

      "Positive :-> Love this base for charging my kindle. You still need to use a good cord for most effective charge. With a good cord and this base your kindle will charge in under 30 minutes.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my 11 yr old and my main concern was parental controls. Parental controls are an awesome feature and were easy to set up. Amazon had plenty of free apps for kids that i didnt need to purchase extra. Thank you I'm very happy with this purchase!\n",

Wish they would do something like this for cell phones to read in the sunlight!\n",
      "Positive :-> A friend recommended I buy one. He paid $50 for his. When I saw it on sale at Best Buy for $39 I snagged one, I wish I understood the features better. I mostly use it for reading before bed. It's my first time doing so on a Kindle. Was surprised to like it so much! I live in a small trailer. It is great to an electronic library.\n",
      "Positive :-> For the price it should come with a hdmi & wireless keyboard.\n",

      "Positive :-> It's a kindle...great kindle for a great price. Expandable memory can be used to expand your movie or game library. It also has great sound and picture quality.\n",
      "Positive :-> I didn't think it was possible to love my Kindle more! But I got the paper white to replace my Kindle touch. It's even more crisp and doesn't strain my eyes. Plus, I can read even when its shady or dark- because of the backlight. I like that I can adjust the brightness too. Worth every penny ! LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Highly recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> One of those things that you never realize you needed until you actually get it. I can't imagine not having this thing now! Definitely recommended\n",

I haven't had any problems with it so far other than it's so thin, you need a case so you don't drop it. Very easy to add games, music, and books. I have even ordered items through Amazon without problems. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very useful for those who purchase many titles, who travel frequently, or who just are seeking to save money on buying books.\n",
      "Positive :-> All apps I like for free, great video quality for Netflix, easy to order from Amazon site.\n",

      "Positive :-> This is great little tablet that is very user friendly and lightweight!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as part of the Black Friday sale. For $40, it serves well as a light use tablet (Skype, e-mail, video, etc.). The ads and heavy Amazon product front load push are annoying. Can't change or hide any preloaded features. Can't complain much for the price and the fact that I won't break a sweat if it falls out my car or gets misplaced.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second amazon fire purchase. I wanted one for home and one to keep with me for traveling and work. It's was to negotiate and fits all my basic daily needs.\n",

      "Positive :-> This is a Very nice option to get to my favorite content. I used audio receiver for simple connection to TV and additional audio options. The push button voice interface works as well as my Echo. As a Prime member content is plentiful and broad enough for my entertainment.\n",

      "Positive :-> I love the fact, I can read in bed at night, and the backlight is adjustable so it does not bother my husband sleeping. Only negative is it takes a few longer seconds then I would like to power off.\n",

      "Positive :-> Need one for your kindle...\n",
      "Negative :-> I had an old ipad and when it quit I decided to go for the amazon fire tablet--really only used it to play games and for entertainment....i hate it---battery life is very short I pretty much need to keep it plugged in at all times, and it freezes and just shuts out of screens.

She is pretty witty and very fun to mess around with and understands you even with music or TV on at loud volumes. I love the features and can't wait for more compatible devices to come out.\n",

      "Positive :-> I got this for 35 dollars as part of Thanksgiving promotion. Its normal price is 50. Its a good starting level tab for basic purpose. Its not as smooth as IPAD or Galaxy note but its ok for basic browsing. I specifically got this for my 3 year old to watch Youtube and play some light games and it works perfect. I am not much used to android so I found it a bit tricky to use. It also has a slot for microSD card so that solves your memory issues.\n",

      "Positive :-> Got this as a housewarming for a friend who bought a new house.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Has tons of free games for the kids not so good for the average tablet user as its not that powerful but I guess that's only my opinion\n",
      "Positive :-> After all the great reviews I thought it would be wonderful to use as a helping hand running a business solo. However, for this case it isn't very helpful. Unlike Cortana or Siri, Alexa only works with commands based on the petty apps that can generate the commands. It can't use your whole phone or computer to pull up apps or anything special. Even the simple stuff like weather was a hassle to try to change location and simple data like calendar, and anything you want to learn just refers back to the Alexa app which by the way is absolutely awful. You can't use your own calendar alone, everything has to be linked to one of the several lackluster apps that have been created. I think this will be great in the future but as far as offices go, it seems an unnecessary false luxury. At home with smart appliances may be its only use. (Recommended for home entertainment use only).\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device. This could seriously make me ditch any cable service.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great product. Light weight. I wish it has wifi to download from online.\n",

      "Positive :-> This is my first \"e-reader\" i couldnt be happier!!\n",
      "Positive :-> VERY parent friendly! Extremely thorough parental controls. We were told at the store there was no way to block internet or control other content on a tablet, so we decided not to get one. Then, we read about the integrated parental controls with the Fire and gave it a try. It allowed us to do everything we wanted and more. Also, very easy set up and use!\n",
      "Positive :-> These were purchased as Christmas presents for my grandchildren. However I did open the packages to be sure they were fully charged and updated. I was surprised at how fast the response time was and how easy they are to navigate. My grandchildren are going to love them!\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice size to work with, not too big or too small to carry with you\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for the bedroom. Now I have to buy another for the family room.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have loved Amazon's Kindles from the start. Everything is user friendly and Amazon's customer service can't be beat!\n",

      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet for my 10 year old son and he loves it. Great for movies, games and reading books online. Definetly would recommend it as a starter tablet for young children. The hard protective cover is a plus.\n",
      "Positive :-> INEXPENSIVE AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL. WORKS AS GOOD AS TOP BRANDS.\n",
      "Positive :-> It was just a few weeks ago that I was bemoaning the fact that I did not scoop up an Echo back when they were being released last year. Not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price, but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device...Well, here I am, a year late to the game and I can now proudly say that I own both an Echo and this new little Tap! Can I just say that I am OBSESSED with all things Echo and Alexa. These are devices that you may not realize how much you'll use it until you've given them a try.I have been spending the last few years getting our home automated. I currently use a combination of Smartthings, IFTTT and Logitech Harmony to control the home. Alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice. For me, this is the killer feature. I can integrate all three parts of our home control right into Echo/Tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup.Read more\n",

I discover new uses for my Echo every day. Coordinates tasks with my cellphone and allows for programming contingencies (if this, then that). I love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> OMG - who needs a personal assistant when you have Alexa.Love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I'm in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet .\n",

      "Positive :-> Defiantly worth upgrading from the fire stick does not freeze nor does it get hot and need a cool down time.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome!! Keeps my life in order and helps me with my Amazon shopping. Her jokes are a little lame but entertaining.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the echo in white. I think it looks better than the black one. Also bought a dot for the bedroom. If you get this and an Insteon starter kit, you can use Alexa to control your plug in lamps. It works well and I recommend buying it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting.\n",
      "Positive :-> I wanted a replacement comparable to my original, and this filled the bill.\n",
      "Positive :-> Something new for my wife. She is still earning how to navigate the item but enjoys more apps at her finger tips. Its small and compact and easy t take on trips so she can read, take pictures or listen to her music.\n",
      "Positive :-> My newphew loves it! He's 4 years old and can easily use the tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> This amazon echo speaker is wonderful. Great quality sound speaker for music and does so many neat things. My favorite feature is the grocery and to do list. Way to stay organized hands free!\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire replaces my Kindle reader and serves this purpose well. When using as a tablet with WIFI on, battery runs down very quickly but oh well just need to charge often. Really like the camera. Not the greatest pics but again serves my purposes well.\n",
      "Positive :-> I originally got the Amazon Tap. I had read the reviews that mentioned that the sound was hollow with no bottom. That was correct. I returned it got the Echo and there is a big difference. The only problem is that it does not have portable power pack. I have seen 3rd party source and I'm gonna try it.I highly recommend this item. It is all that it claims.\n",
      "Positive :->  I needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stays so I decided based on price to get the kindle 8 and I am pleased I did! For only $89 the bright picture, sound, storage, and ease of use is well worth it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Speaker quality is better than expected, works well in the living room, convenient addition\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my Mom who is legally blind and she loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is great for kids, my 3yr old uses and it has fallen and the cover really protects it. The kids section is filled with lots of apps\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great box better than the firestick and other boxes\n",
      "Positive :-> The echo allows everyone in my house to add to my shopping list... love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Have had it awhile and still learning and adding to it's skills but so far it's pretty good. I'll be adding the additional home automation features soon so we'll see how that goes.\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice item. Only drawback, occasional pauses upon turning page or creating bookmark.\n",
      "Positive :-> My child is having the time of their life, great for small hands.\n",
      "Positive :-> I never thought that I would need an e-reader since I have the samsung Note, but I am now would not read on the Note anymore. The paperwhite makes reading so much better, my eyes don't feel tired as quick with the paperwhite. Highly recommended!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Very ideal for viewing movies, and th selections very updated!\n",
      "Positive :-> Its great love to watch my favorite shows and read books\n",
      "Positive :-> having a lot of fun teaching alexa and also learning a lot of new facts\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it as a Christmas for a family member. She uses it everyday. The music sounds great!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> The apps are better, it charges faster and the camera is really neat!\n",
      "Positive :-> GReat an fun product for the whole family. Kid wakes up an asks Alexa the weather to get ready.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.\n",
      "Positive :-> Initially it has a hard time recognizing your voice but then it adapts and makes everything so much easier. It gives me the daily news and tells bedtime stories.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use...simple set up. I'd recommend it to anyone\n",
      "Positive :-> It's very good product and I recommended this to buy it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Over all the product is good batteries that are supplied seem to of been dead but other wise very good\n",
      "Positive :-> First time with a tablet, wanted one for years just to watch Netflix and basic games. Very happy, the screen looks great and the speaker is loud. So far, so good!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this product for a 2 year old. It is easy enough for her to operate. She almost can operate it better than I can.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle Paperwhite is the best bang for your buck when it comes to purchasing an E-reader.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle is nice for road trips to watch movies. Good battery life. It's cool.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to replace a dedicated kids tablet (another brand) that had wonderful software but not a replaceable battery. Barely got a year and a half out of the other brand. The price difference between this and the dedicated kids version was largely a software suite subscription so I bought this. Along with her mom we found free and age appropriate software. I loaded up a micro SD card with music and audio stories. Both grand daughters love it, as they are 5 and 3 I bought the bumper to help protect it. It's not in the same league as my Samsung tablet but for 1/8 its cost or 1/6 the cost of the dedicated kid brand it's great.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am building out a relatively large, advanced smart home and it was only natural to integrate voice assistant features to the mix. I use the Echo to control Phillips Hus lights and even my Schlage lock. Every morning I wake up and get news and weather from Alexa as I'm getting ready. What a wonderful product.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good gift for someone. Got this for my girlfriends mom for xmas.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Fire TV! I'm both an Amazon Prime and Netflix customer and this works very well for me! I haven't had mine very long but I use them everyday ( I have 2 of them) so I am learning to navigate through them very well. I also use the Amazon Music quite a lot! Great product!\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is getting smarter and gaining a sense of humor as well similar to Siri. The speaker sounds great and Alexa curates the music of our chosen genre in the house all the time.\n",
      "Positive :-> I believe it could be a little faster. Screen isn't very tough, broke in a few months.\n",
      "Positive :-> asesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> For its size this is a pretty well made product that produces great sound and I love the portability.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is the greatest product ever I use it around the house all of the time\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best kindle yet. Love the features and soft back-lighting.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a great tablet for every day needs. Great for games, internet access and reading Kindle books.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works super well, always plays good music and movies\n",
      "Positive :-> Still feeling my way, but if I have any more question will check with the geek squad.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was so excited to start streaming 4k with this and the disappointment was terrible. It just never seemed to hit 4k while my Smart TV has no problem with it. The only reason I bought it was because I loved the original Fire TV and loved the setup. Also, it was glitchy and laggy. I gave it 2 days and returned it.\n",
      "Positive :-> The fire runs well and was easy to set up. The pop up adds are a bit annoying but the tablet works well.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had previously purchased the fire stick. It works good and had what you need. I bought the TV model. It's super fast. I love it and would highly recommend it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire Tablet: Catch up on your reading or browse the Web with this tablet, which offers access to Amazon Underground, so you can download apps and games and discover exciting new entertainment. Front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments or chat with friends\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves his tablet it keeps him occupied and well behaved\n",
      "Positive :-> This item was so great for our TV streaming needs we went back and bought another one for the other TV. Only down side is the remote is so small it is easy to lose. *beep* Alexa tell us a joke.\n",
      "Positive :-> He loves his new tablet! For a thirteen year old he loves it and takes it everywhere.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product, needs a few more things added on but works very well\n",
      "Positive :-> I have used the Kindle app on an iPad and Android tablet and phone and I love it. This is my first Kindle device, so I can't compare it to previous Kindle versions. The only drawback to using the Kindle app on the previoulsy-mentioned devices is that they can't be seen in direct sunlight. And that is the biggest advantage I see to owning a Kindle--you can read outside in daylight. Also, the kindle is very light and portable and easy to use. It does what it says it will do and you can't beat the battery life. The X-ray feature is also a bonus that you don't get with the app.\n",
      "Positive :-> Voice recognition is nearly perfect! Quality and performance of the Echo is impeccable. WiFi connection and Alexa's connection to our Smart Devices is also great (much better than I had ever anticipated). Music is played all through Alexa which is convienent to the next level with great sound quality. We also have two Dots and a Tap; all highly recommended.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use and great for the kids. Lightweight and easy to travel with.\n",
      "Positive :-> Extremely sturdy construction. This is a great tablet and very durable. It can take a fall and keep working as if nothing happened. I would recommend this for someone who has a special needs child. I would definitely buy another one.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the tablet as a gift for a friend's daughter in another country and they just luv it. She is the talk of her province because of the usefulness and learning games that came with the tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for my son and he loves it. He enjoys playing on it and enjoying his free time app.\n",
      "Negative :-> Bought this for my Mom as a gift and was really disappointed. This device DOES NOT RUN FULL ANDROID. You cannot get third party apps even though they sell it as tablet. This device is only good if you only use Amazon (shopping, books, games), otherwise you can't download anything - not even a weather app. Not worth my money to be so limited - Returned the device and got the Lenovo Tab 2 A7 and we are MUCH happier with it!\n",
      "Positive :-> item has a fast processor and is cheaper than the Roku and Apple TV for cord cutting\n",
      "Neutral :-> This works very well for a reader but if you want to browse online it is not so good. The default Silk browser is slow; side loaded Opera and it is slow; Chrome is slow and Firefox is slow. So I have to assume that it is the Fire that is slow WiFi / browsing. But then it was an inexpensive piece of hardware.\n",
      "Positive :-> This piece of electronics is amazing. Alexa can answer questions for you, give you weather and news updates, and play your favorite music. Have had the unit several weeks and am very pleased with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa from Amazon offers amazing functionality including having access to Amazon's music library, it can control your Hue lighting, has the ability to provide news and weather forecasts and it even sets timers when you are cooking! The product is a must have!\n",
      "Positive :-> The best gift for my 2 years old nieceGreat tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for the price and easy to install and use. Learn new stuff everyday\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law. He loves gadgets so I knew he would appreciate the Echo. I had received this as a gift last Christmas and absolutely love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I thought it would have more skills but overall it work in progress\n",
      "Positive :-> its great, i hooked my amazon prime up to it, that is the best\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased these to give to customer who hit a specific goal, and the competition was fierce - so fierce, in fact, that I decided to award TWO of them to the top two customers who both achieved the goal.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good size for kids. Recommend buying a case for it since its small\n",
      "Positive :-> I was not sure what to expect of Alexa, but after using it for some time I wonder why I have 2K of sound equipment. The sound is outstanding it is everything as advertised.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product to kids for playing games.sssssssssss\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my sister and she loves it. She plays a lot of games on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Daughter loved this as a gift. She get migraines if she were to read Ebooks on her normal tablet or phone the screen is dull like a book page which leave it easy on her eyes and fingers crossed no headaches\n",
      "Positive :-> Godchild loves it. He works it very well. Haven't had any problems\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the Echo! Hands free!! Just tell Alexa what song you want to hear. We have ours in the kitchen and call out songs while cooking and eating. Turn on lights, change the thermostat, and even order a pizza to be delivered. Gotta' have this gadget!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> great for kids of all ages..........................\n",
      "Positive :-> Can play almost any song on the spot, Does have some trouble with random questions, but overall it answers most.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my elderly mother who had another tablet that broke. It was easy to set up. More importantly, it's easy for her to understand. I did have to create an Amazon account for her just so I could download her favorite apps. The only challenge I had was she uses Gmail for her email accounts. It took me a couple of tries to get her Gmail into the stock email app. So far, she is happy as a lark with her new tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> i brought this for my house and i love this fire tv! i can watch just all sort of internet things on it! best thing i have brought in a long time for TV.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great gift idea and easy to install and use - would highly recommend!\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the product work vey well and I am very happy with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Use this device everyday. So much easier to carry than an iPad. Plus, Alexa is amazing.\n",
      "Positive :-> The fire 7 is easy to read books and stuff. The kids love playing games on it. We really love the tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> This generation works much better than my previous Kindle Fire. I'm very happy with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the ease with which I was able to set up and connect Alexa to the internet in my home. I set an alarm to get up to go to the gym, a reminder for things, ask her the weather and she wakes me with the trivia of the day - which is sometimes very amusing !! I also ask her the news, the weather and what's on my calendar for the day. Every day I try something new and am always delighted with her and amazed by each new attribute of my Echo. I have a Dot in my bedroom as well and plan to add one to my home office. I think I'm becoming addicted to these wonderful and helpful units.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa and I are best friends. She plays music, tells jokes, reminds of my shopping list, and on and on..... She's great!\n",
      "Positive :-> What can I say but out of this world. This thing is so cool.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's nice to go out in the yard and check my online stuff but it's just too small.\n",
      "Positive :-> this equipment will help us with our viewing of movies that we want.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to replace a much earlier version. This is so much more readable I'm sorry I waited for my other to crash before I upgraded.\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet exceeds the price expectations. Great for reading books, ok for browsing. The time warner cable tv app works well with this device.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Tap is outstanding. There have been more applications slowly becoming avaliable. It is simple to use. It works with our Nest, which is a nice application.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of \"back\" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the \"X\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"new items.\" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under \"new items\" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the \"home\" menu. It's the \"recent\" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's \"On Deck\" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the \"on deck\" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a little slow on some things but otherwise I really like the tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great e-reader, has a built in back light for reading in low light and in the dark.\n",
      "Positive :-> Far and away blows away the Echo Dot in terms of sound quality. The higher cost is offset by the need to purchase a decent quality bluetooth speaker for the Dot.\n",
      "Positive :-> The kindle paper white works perfectly. The battery life is amazing!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product at a great price! So glad I bought this!\n",
      "Positive :-> I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it\n",
      "Positive :-> Wife wanted something better for her reading and this was Perfect!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have an older kindle and wanted more space. This works very well\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best for reading and not getting out of concentration with other apps. The battery lasts a lifetime. The best for traveling.\n",
      "Positive :-> Install was easy. Only issue was using it with PSVue.\n",
      "Positive :-> We absolutely love the Amazon echo aka Alexa. She is very helpful with information from the weather to new to sports. And listening to our favorite music. And plenty more. It's voice activated. Very easy to use. So anyone could do it\n",
      "Positive :-> This is just as good for many of the everyday type stuff as the ipad but at a fraction of the price. The only thing that I would change is making the volume louder.\n",
      "Positive :-> We purchased this for our son (9) and it works great for him.\n",
      "Positive :-> I already have a Kindle, and a tablet, but I wanted something smaller to take when traveling to download movies to. This is perfect! Good price, and the color and clarity is perfect!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for son. Loved it. Now daughter wants one. Easy to use, and looks good in house.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my daughter who wanted an iPad, but for about half the price she is completely happy with it - she even calls it her iPad. I think I may even buy one for myself to replace my aging iPad.\n",
      "Positive :-> I haven't encountered any issues with it so far. I really like the screen mirroring capability because it lets me project my miracast-enabled Windows 10 laptop and my Galaxy S5 to the big screen. It really can turn any TV into a Smart TV.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great gift for my sonEasy to useEasy set upLight weight\n",
      "Positive :-> Great media player for watching movies and shows from netflix,hulu, etc. easy to navigate, quick quad core cpu keeps things from lagging, and voice commands via the voice remote make this a winner.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best purchase you will ever make. Intall kodi and go cable free\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for watching movies and reading books. It is also a great tablet because I can set my children on their own individual side, and set up parental controls\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa can definitely be useful with creating shipping lists, entertaining guests, and integrating into a smart home. If you have young children it can be a little frustrating as they tend to compete for controlling the device and there is no way to have Alexa ignore a command given to it.Specialty command lines can be confusing if you don't get the studying right.Overall, it is useful for most things and the music services it connects to allow for a wide variety of entertainment.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Amazon Echo for my husband because he loves music. I was expecting the sound to be okay, but not for it to sound as good as it does. The speakers are of excellent quality. He is very pleased with the quality of the sound, as am I.Even though we use the Amazon Echo for mostly playing music, telling the forecast and adding items to our shopping list, to be perfectly honest, I’d love to have another one because we all use her all over the house and I hate having to unplug and move her.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for playing all types of music, checking the weather, asking questions for things you're looking for, play games and so much more. Love Alexa. Can't wait to learn all the other things she can do that I haven't learned about yet. I would surely recommend it to anyone. You can also use it to run various things in your home.\n",
      "Positive :-> Sure. It's not an iPad, but it's only 50 bucks! Amazon is taking a loss on these in order to sell you their content. There are a few restrictions, like an advertisement on the lock screen and only access to Amazon's App store. These are small prices to pay for such a wonderfully performing tablet. Also, Amazon Underground gives you access to a ton of paid apps for FREE. If this is your first tablet purchase, it is definitely a winner. For those not new to the tablet world, it is definitely worth having just to carry around when you need it. You won't feel so bad if someone steals it or you lose/break it as opposed to an iPad. Just buy it already!\n",
      "Positive :-> my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive.\n",
      "Positive :-> Wonderful\n",
      "Positive :-> I haven't learned all of the tricks and tips. It it sure is nifty so far!\n",
      "Positive :-> I am a big fan of this tablet, very functional for price\n",
      "Positive :-> It was pretty cheap and you can surf the web. a good buy for the bucks.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for kids inexpensive wouldn't mind buying again\n",
      "Positive :-> I got the paperwhite as a replacement for my 1st generation Kindle. It has great features, but is still easy to use. I like that it is not backlit like a tablet, making it much easier on your eyes.\n",
      "Positive :-> Inexpensive gift. Should have bought more to give away for Christmas\n",
      "Positive :-> Siri is great but Alexa takes hints up a notch. I have gotten Philips Hue bulbs and love that I can control lights throughout my house by just asking Alexa to manage them.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet that works well for ebooks and basic apps such as internet browsers etc. Great bargain for the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> For the price of this tablet its well worth the money very durable and works well\n",
      "Positive :-> Out the box this devise works good and plays well with others.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for any user. The picture is beautiful and it is easy to navigate. It is compact and lightweight and simply elegant.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the idea of Alexa and the next step to home automation. Alexa is fun and helpful at the same time. Updates on the weather and news as well as some facts, how to spell, etc. Sometimes it does not have an answer like \"when did NASA land on the moon\"? I can control my thermostat, play all sorts of music, radio stations, control it all from my phone and more. There is a third party software company IFTTT that has appellate to allow you to accomplish much more with Alexa.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchase this tablet on Black Friday for my classroom while at work and my toddler while at home. Pros-I've mainly used it at work for Class Dojo and it's good for that purpose. At home I've used it for a Fisher Price ABC app. Both run okay with minimum lag. Cons-The volume is very low and the ads are annoying but for what I'm using it for it works.\n",
      "Positive :-> My old Kindle finally wouldn't charge any more so I went to Best Buy to see if it could be fixed. Too bad! It couldn't! SOOOO, I got a new one that is amazing! And it is so user-friendly I figured out how to borrow books from the library all by myself! Couldn't be any more pleased.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids really enjoyed this tablet. Its kid friendly...\n",
      "Positive :-> Way faster than the fire stick. I hook up to my Garage TV to watch live boxing from the ShowTime app. Plus many more apps. Have Prime subscription but not necessary in my opinion.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great device for entertaining at home or just lounging on your own.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Amazon Kindle is awesome! Has all it's features including a built-in camera!! Purchase this for my son for his 16th birthday! He absolutely loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it! Easy to use. So simple to order books and they are immediately downloaded.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for beginners. My staff really liked this treat for christmas\n",
      "Positive :-> I've found this to be an excellent tablet for children for the following reasons:Free Time Unlimited- You can create individual profiles for up to five children, and they can have access to a wide assortment of age appropriate apps, videos, and books. If you purchase the Kid's bundle a year of Free Time Unlimited is included with the tablet along with a shock absofbing case.Price Performance- You get a relatively powerful tablet for the $49.00 price tag. If you subscribe to Amazon Prime this tablet becomes a great travel companion. Prime allows you to download movies and TV episodes to your tablet for later viewing. This is a handy feature for me since I travel for work, and spend a good deal of time on planes. Cons: The only drawback I've found is the Web browser. It's not supported on in flight WiFi, but the ability to download from Prime for later viewing balances that out. I will experiment with side-loading Chrome and see if it works.\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves this thing. He is always on it. Great learning tool and it keeps him entertained\n",
      "Positive :-> very easy set up and no issues with it starting to work. going to get proper light switches so it can turn my lights on and off\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my wife on her Birthday, she loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product and good customer services. The person I met in the store explained me all the features.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is on of the best media players on the market.I have cromecast and roku and this is the tops .\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second Echo. The family just love it. Using IFTTT, I have it working with so many other devices. I just wish I could set the address to outside of the US.\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves this, uses it for internet access and listening to music.\n",
      "Positive :-> The quality is awesome for the price. Amazon products are always cool.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a great product, but giving the price, you can find the same thing in the form of a cheap tablet that does more. Still a solid product tho\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for reading books onlineI would recommend to friends\n",
      "Positive :-> holds a charge better than any tablet i have ever had\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift. It is a great tablet for a great price!\n",
      "Positive :-> This would be a perfect gift for anyone. Easy to use, and we'll put together device.\n",
      "Positive :-> best e reader to date. yes it's a bit pricey, but it reads like a real book.\n",
      "Positive :-> great tablet to use around the house, and on the go . my wife like to read alot\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had an echo for a couple of years and absolutely love it, so when I saw them on sale, I decided to buy one for my classroom. They are well worth the price!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great reader, it feels like the best evolution of the Paperwhite. The auto-brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. The new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.The power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. The backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen Paperwhite.The only issue I have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette, I have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles. And of course, this thing is expensive when compared to the Paperwhite.\n",
      "Positive :-> I find this perfect for reading. It's much lighter than the mini iPad. Easier on the eyes.\n",
      "Positive :-> I debated on getting Alexa for a while now and I'm actually sad that I did, this is a fun tool to have. I love being able to access Sirius XM on it in the mornings. It's easy to set-up and takes maybe 5 minutes. Must have if you are creating a smart house, which I am.\n",
      "Positive :-> The back light is better for your eyes then reading on a tablet or phone and is similar to reading a paperback book but you can read in the dark without needing a book light\n",
      "Positive :-> The simple set up, ease of use, and features of the Echo make it a cool little device to have around the house.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to hold & read with no strain to eyes. Love that I can highlight text.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well with Amazon's services, hands free Spotify and news too. The speaker sounds great centralized in a large area, and the voice recognition is extremely accurate. Looking forward to getting into the home automation aspect soon.\n",
      "Positive :-> My boys love their new tablets due to the cool features, books, apps and games. I love the parental controls, processor speed, battery life and light weight. Combined with a great discount at Best Buy and you get a win, win, WIN!\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo is tough to deal with. Doesn't understand most the questions I ask. You definitely can't do a follow up question. Speaker sounds great. Looks great. Also will hook up to devices for automation. Hopefully they update it for comms, cuz google home is killing it there.\n",
      "Positive :-> Home assistant x bluetooth speaker. Alexa is awesome!\n",
      "Positive :-> Not as good as the higher end Kindles, but nice product for the price point. If you're an avid reader, and especially if you are an Amazon Prime member then this product offers an incredibly great price for entry into the Kindle reading products, especially now that there is Amazon Prime reading. For even more value and selection, join Kindle Unlimited. In short: This little device and a Prime account offer an incredible selection for countless hours of reading. I can't see how you can go wrong, unless you plan to watch videos and then I recommend one of the nicer Kindles...maybe? This one can do the job, it's just an entry level, basic model; but for reading, I don't believe you'll ever wish for more.\n",
      "Positive :-> Run nice and smooth in long run. Overall great buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> So, I won't be able to go into super depth for this. I only needed a device to run one app. For my purposes, it literally has one job.I can say, for the price, it's far more responsive that I would have ever guessed. And the screen clarity is great. Good battery life.I was disappointed that the lock screen would always show ads. I don't have the package, and I don't recall it being forward with this fact. In the settings, I said I had to pay $15 to disable ads because \"in exchange for the subsidized price, they can do ads\" or something like that.I kinda get that, and for most people this may not be a big deal. But for my reasons, this is a bit unprofessional to have. So when buying it, whatever the price, you may have to shell out $15 more.Still, all said and done, good price for simple needs.\n",
      "Positive :-> Was very surprised with this tablet, nice beginner tablet, works well with Mine Craft pocket edition with no lags. Purchased 3 for my kids and niece on Black Friday for $33.\n",
      "Positive :-> What a time we live in...Jetsons are real, this is a must have.\n",
      "Positive :-> love my kindle it's awesome read on it in the dark all the time\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price for tablet. Works great for my 3 year old that loves trains so can watch all the train videos on Amazon Prime and can limit the time with the FreeTime settings on the tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice tablet for a great price as I purchased per black Friday sale on-line\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great even outside easy to learn how to download and settings\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet and ereader together. Great for beginner's and all others my six year old son knows how to work this.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice and good tablet to do basic things like surfing.\n",
      "Positive :-> Better then a E-book, more options and versatility\n",
      "Positive :-> Everything I wanted. Still learning on using her..\n",
      "Positive :-> I replaced another Kindle Fire that was broken after I sat on it! I liked all the Fires that I have had so much that I bought another and it is still in use.\n",
      "Positive :-> My husband and I purchased 3 of these for each of our kiddos and to say they're a hit would be a massive understatement. And the parental controls on these are awesome. We love our new Fires!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Both my Boys, ages 3 and 7 absolutely LOVE their tablets! I couldn't be happier with them and very satisfied with the price!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an excellent product, and Bestbuy sold it with great condition.\n",
      "Positive :-> expensive but good with integrated Illumination. has lot of amazon ads, and they asking to buy some new books that \"suitable\" for you! I had the old version with small keyboard and it was with 0 ads..\n",
      "Positive :-> It very convenient it small and it work awesome can put in my purse or\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had the Fire 1st gen and Fire stick. All have been great. The added power on this 2nd gen is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet, great resolution, very light and fast speed.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great beginner tablet for a small children. Definitely recommend this starter tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> These are Christmas presents for my granddaughters. I am sure they will love them\n",
      "Positive :-> My wife loves the tablet.it is light weight !!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> use it for taking pictures of family for memories.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a rip-off! I will use my apple USB plug instead, for free!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second Fire TV and the setup is as easy as the first. Very simple to use and the benefits pay for itself. Worth it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Item worked fine\n",
      "Positive :-> Love Alexa. Dependent upon good wifi. When it works it is a great item.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great addition to my expanding smart home. The speaker sounds great and alexa is very responsive.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the Echo for my husband as an early Christmas present. He loved it! We used it all during the holiday season to play holiday music. We use it every morning to check the weather. We also bought a smart plug and use the Echo to turn on our table lamp as we walk in the door in the evenings. We compete against each other in Jeopardy every day - he usually wins! As a result of my experience with the Echo, I bought 4 more for Christmas gifts and my enthusiasm for the Echo resulted it one being under many of my friends' families Christmas trees!\n",
      "Positive :-> Didn't really do it for me. Being an ipad user, this unit was really foreign. If you are familiar with Amazon Fire products, it will be great for you.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was very pleased with the items I ordered from Best Buy. They were well respresented online, thank you.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle Voyager has a very easy to read screen with great resolution.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for streaming Amazon Prime amongst others. This is a must have, especially if a 4K tv is owned. Love it. Quick navigation speed, due to the memory and processor this box exhibits.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for my 4yr ild daughter, and its good for kids. A little different from a regular android tablet. Layout has alot going on but can get used to it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what's not to love about this product?\n",
      "Positive :-> Works smoothly, no problems. Amazin has a great selection of tv shows and movies.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very durable and easy for my 5yr old to use. The price was just a plus.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a small and compact device that is easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> bought this for my 2yr old and he loves it. great price for the features\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a gift for my mother, she's not very tech savvy but she's able to easily navigate this tablet. She loves it and the price was great for the product.\n",
      "Negative :-> Worked wonderful and fast the first couple of weeks and then just stopped working. I understand that sometimes things are just a defective piece so I logged into Amazon and attempted to exchange it,, but found out the window for exchanging it had closed. I would have attempted to return it sooner but I was out of state for several weeks visiting and helping my daughter who had just given birth to triplets, and so I'd decided I would just wait till I returned home to do it. By the time I got around to it, it was too late. So I totally wasted my money. If Amazon corrects this matter and send me a replacement, I will update my review.\n",
      "Positive :-> Actually easier to hold than a paperback, and might even be lighter!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for my wife who reads a lot of books. She loves it!!\n",
      "Positive :-> It's great for kids for a cheap iPad alternative however need credit card and no way to prevent accidental purchases\n",
      "Positive :-> We purchase this for our son and he loves it. We are able to track his interaction online and he really loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great, easy to use for my 4 year old. I can adjust settings easily. Easy set up\n",
      "Positive :-> This is what I wanted. Easy to use. Can read outdoors or indoors. Easy to add books that I purchase. I would recommend to anyone looking for a similar devise.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been so impressed and my kids love it as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up. Has great sound. Nice to talk too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Grandkids love it now they have their own personal tablets and I love that it has parental control\n",
      "Positive :-> Best tablet for the money, also great because of the color selection.\n",
      "Positive :-> Wow I was missing out on all the fun and convenient application this little thing can do. I thought oh like a toy and Ill get tired of it, wrong. I now have lights set to it, drop in on friends, ask any question I need answers to, get step by step recipes, just a thousand things, to many to list. Get yourself one, its awesome!\n",
      "Positive :-> We have Google home and the Echo. We like Google Home better.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter is 1 and doesn't pay much attention to it because she'd rather have my phone. However, as a parent I'd rather have her play with the tablet because it has many free learning game apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Fire Tablet - it has beautiful screen and many extra features that my older Tablet did not have - while it is still a compact size, it is light and pleasant to use. I would recommend again and again.\n",
      "Positive :-> One of the best streaming devices for the price. Bonus points if you are a Prime member or invested in Amazon's infrastructure.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don't use so can't comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> I used to use an amazon fire tv stick which worked fine. A friend recommended trying the fire tv because it was faster and had the ability to have more storage. Tried it and haven't looked back since.\n",
      "Positive :-> This does what is suppose to do, and I haven't had not over issue with it... I give it a thumbs up!\n",
      "Positive :-> Just what I needed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for the kids, picture quality is great and it is durable.\n",
      "Positive :-> We! love this product. It helps with everything....really\n",
      "Positive :-> I recommend this speaker Easy to work great sound\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to navigate and so many option it's unbelievable. This great gadget saving me alot of money canceled my cable subscription.\n",
      "Positive :-> My granddaughter is really enjoying this tablet and even though she is only three she is able to easily use it\n",
      "Positive :-> this amazon fire table is a great bargain. its not a top of the line table and you can tell since the moment you see the price tag but for that price does a whole lot! day to day regular use or just for kids and people that dont really care about some extra features that flagship tablet bring its amazon!\n",
      "Positive :-> I picked this up on Black Friday and ended up returning it the following week. This may be greater for an e-reader but can't replace a tablet for emails / amazon shopping.\n",
      "Positive :-> I wish it had 3G or 4G. Other than that it is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Echo is a great friend in the room who will play whatever music you ask for. It's great to just ask Alexa and the echo responds accurately.\n",
      "Positive :-> You get much better sound from the Echo than from the Dot - need to add a speaker to the Dot, adding to the cost. Wish these devices did a better job of looking info up on the internet. Siri seems to work better in that regard.\n",
      "Neutral :-> It is not an out of the world product but for the price point it is what it is said to be . It does what it advertises nothing more or lessA little slower compared to Samsung Tabs or Ipads but again less then$35 on blackfriday cant complain\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn't be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don't feel like I should have any issues.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had a Kindle Fire for years, but find I can't read it very well in the bright sun. I bought my Kindle paper white for camping and it's perfect out in the direct sun, by the pool. It's also smaller and fits it the pocket of my pool bag easier. Now one stays home, and one stays in the camper.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for getting movies without adding extras to your cable bil. Very small device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to use. A high quality apple product. Good tech!\n",
      "Positive :-> great products lots good appscompatible with many appsloves the speed and quality of priduct for the money\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my niece. She loves it! I am happy she is enjoying it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love that this now has a sd slot. Its amazing to watch movies that we downloaded, read books. Its a little slow but for the price its amazing. Great speakers and picture\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet for the price. Works as well as a more expensive model.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to connect and use!Greats apps Great product Get it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Wife had one for years, she recommended one to a friend for her birthday and her husband purchased this one for her.\n",
      "Positive :-> Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. We purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100% better.\n"

      "Positive :-> My wife loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased these tablets for my grandchildren. They are young and do not need anything fancy. So, knowing these tablets are simple and easy to use for young children was the right one to purchase. They are very happy with the tablets and it is easy for them to understand and use. Excellent purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for a reasonable price. A lot of fun!\n",
      "Positive :-> Found that this device is extremely convenient, but it often has problems with buffering. They seem to mostly come from outside apps so that's why I am still giving it a 4.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my fire i have always wanted one for when I read\n",
      "Positive :-> I use it primarily for music and also for news, weather, time and entertainment. The only negative I can say is that when I ask it to play music by a specific artist it randomly throws in Christmas music. Christmas music is great in December but it's August.\n",
      "Positive :-> Our family has made a echo a part of our ordinary day to day life from playing music to asking questions to just playing with the thing\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the camera is good and it's very fast wifi work awesome\n",
      "Positive :-> Turns on and off fans, lights, water sprinklers, changes thermostat temperature and entertains.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it ! very easy to use!!! Good picture for movies!\n",
      "Positive :-> This was for my grandson and he loved it especially because of alexis app\n",
      "Positive :-> The price is really attractive, and kindle is good to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product requires significantly less buffering than the fire stick.For sure would recommend over the Fire Stick if you are planning on using this for streaming, especially for movies or live TV.This product also incorporates Alexa so you can control your smart home from the comfort of your couch.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect tablet for beginners. Simple to use great color and perfect size.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love these tablets I have two, I would definitely recommend they are light weight and hold a battery for a long time, great for emails , surfing the web or just shopping im gonna buy another for sure you should by this product\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loves her tablet because she can carry it to all places\n",
      "Positive :-> My only wish is I would be more computer litterate. I have trouble understanding what to do next to continue so I go back to start of games. I bought for the Kindle and reading apps. but have put netflix on it\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a pretty good tablet for the price. The only thing is when I gave it to my Niece for the holidays that it had debris under the screen in which the backlight amplified their existence.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10\" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved.\n",
      "Positive :-> Provides television options without the cost of cable. Easy to setup and use.\n",
      "Positive :-> If looking to get an all in one box, this one works great!\n",
      "Positive :-> It is amazing what this Echo can do! I would recommend this for anyone!\n",
      "Positive :-> Was over a friends house and they had one so I decided to get one. This is awesome.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7\" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a Christmas present for our child and it was exactly what we expected.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my Daughter who loves using it. It's lots of fun to ask for a daily joke.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for leisure/reading for fun. Not for students.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome product it's better than cable t.v my family and all love it\n",
      "Positive :-> The item for my son is 4 years old he really likes it it's a good buy\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged. It has survived countless falls from my 3 yr old. He loves it and it keeps him learning for hours.\n",
      "Positive :-> got this product for my granddaughter. im #1 grandma now\n",
      "Positive :-> I primarily use this as a media tablet and it does it pretty well. The expandable storage is nice and it has around 6-7 hours of continuous local video play. Downsides to this product are the bad external speaker and limited apps available, but hey it's $50.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for my 12 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She is over the moon happy with it! She needed no help in setting it up and using it. She used gift cards to load books and has been busy reading over Christmas vacation.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought as iPad alternative for children 8 and 6 for reading and game play. Kids had iPad minis that both had charging port failures requiring costly repair/replacement. Easy to use, light weight and portable without the worry of significant replacement cost associated with iPad.\n",
      "Positive :-> All of our kids - ages 4, 7 and 8 - have had their own Kindle Fire for almost two years. They're generally pretty careful with them since they've been told that broken Kindles will not be replaced. In one case, the Kindle simply stopped working - it would no longer turn on. There was a great deal going on so we did replace it. What a perfect product for a child! So many apps are available and they can learn new things while thinking they're just having fun. ;)\n",
      "Positive :-> What I really like about the Kindle Paperwhite is being able to read in full sunlight/ambient light, and also the sole dedication to reading. I'm not tempted in the middle of a book to jump over to Twitter, Facebook, etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great addition to all smart home devices.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for grandson because it was cheaper than a kids tablet. Bought a case and it works fine.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good tablet. I only gave it 4 stars because it is only 8 go. Otherwise is working well.\n",
      "Positive :-> The size and clarity of this fire tablet is very nice\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product and lightweight. Battery keeps its charge. Would recommend this product to another young person\n",
      "Positive :-> We love it (that's me & my wife) . My son & daughter-in law & 2 grand-girls all love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works incredibly!!! I will never go back to cable/satellite again!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter love her tablet. And is easy to use, and the battery last longer..\n",
      "Positive :-> I am very happy with this purchase. My kids love it and find it very easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Minimum setup required.Glossary of terms is somewhat limited.Design is attractive and fits into any décor.Sound is good (not Bose, but acceptable)Easy to add features (calendar, To Do List, reminders, etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use this everyday. It's a great buy. Everything you need is ready to go as soon as it turned on.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good speed compared to the other models just the size and weighs very little. Large viewing area for a 8\" tablet HD\n",
      "Positive :-> The Paperwhite is a decent enough product for someone wanting an eInk screen. I don't understand some of the lack of customization options, even on what seems to be simple things. Like why can't I see the TIME in the status bar? Why can't I customize the \"click zones\". Also, contrary to Amazon's claims, my PC app does NOT sync the documents that I emailed to the device (the Android App does, though). I also see their ads when the device is off and starts. If they gave me the ability to save those recommendations (as opposed to \"read now\"), I might have checked a couple of them out by now. Still, for the money, it gets the job done and helps keep my eyes from getting as tired as they did when I just used my phone to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> goes with the kindle for charging port\n",
      "Positive :-> You can read in the sun! It holds more books than I can carry. And you can read your own PDF files\n",
      "Positive :-> The smart home integration in this device is amazing! Great sounding speaker with a full, rich sound. Voice recognition is very good...could hear me from across the room with no problem.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is fourth one.As I upgrade I give my old ones to my kids and bought some for the family.\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought this for my Mother in law who isn't very tech savvy. She has no problems using\n",
      "Positive :-> Brought Alexa home turn her on and immediately she linked to all the smart devices inside my home. I think we were up and running in about 10 minutes. I couldn't be more pleased.\n",
      "Positive :-> Looks nice can't wait to try it out! Great price for a tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy setup and the Echo voice activated searches is a nice touch. Good set of applications as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> it's easy to set up and start enjoying Amazon Prime.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome tablet just what I wanted for my son he has loved it!\n",
      "Positive :-> was skeptical about the small size but a few minutes of checking it out showed me that this is a great little tablet. gave as a gift and she loves it. portable and great display.\n",
      "Positive :-> The echo was easy to set up and interface with all my smart lights and outlets. It's quicker to get the weather through the echo than it is to go on line for it. It does an amazing job in understanding what I am asking for and finding the answer.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this and an AppleTV at the same time. The FireTV is just kinda OK. The interface isn't that intuitive and could use some polish. I had to enter the same username and password for multiple apps over and over (you only have to do it once on the AppleTV)...may not sound like that big of a deal, but it took much longer to setup.In my opinion, the AppleTV is a better product.\n",
      "Positive :-> the kids really liked these for Christmas gifts. They started playing with them right away and really enjoyed them\n",
      "Negative :-> This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes. They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.\n",
      "Neutral :-> The tablet is okay.. my daughter uses it most of the time.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second kindle. I think I overloaded the old one. My only complaint is my old cases don't work on it. Guess I'll just have to buy new!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device and deal, specifically for the little ones\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my niece for Christmas she is going to live it\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my three year old when I bought a new car with no tv in it. She loves that I can download shows and movies and then watch others on wifi.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great addition to the family room. Movies on demand and very smooth streaming!\n",
      "Positive :-> I use my Fire to read, play games, browse, view Facebook, and much more. Great product for the price!\n",
      "Positive :-> Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this kindle for my daughter inlaw for Christmas. She absolutely loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought as a gift for my daughter. She loves it and uses it all the time\n",
      "Positive :-> Young kids love it, easy to use and takes a beating but still cheap enough that if it does happen to break you don't break the bank too\n",
      "Positive :-> It's the second one I've bought. I highly recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "Positive :-> A great E-reader that doubles as a tablet. This model even has an expandabel memory slot. Great price I bought 2 for gifts\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use and please send me a $50 gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash works too.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was hesitant to get a tablet because I was unsure as to how it works and adding a new technology can sometimes be challenging. The Best Buy rep directed me to the Amazon Fire for it's ease of use and he was spot on. Also, the email \"introducing\" me to my tablet was invaluable and helped me immensely. A nice addition to the helpfulness of staff at your store.\n",
      "Positive :-> Gift suitable for an older person to spend time playing games. Visual size is reasonable.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle Fire is great for those that are looking for a tablet to use with WiFi and is even better for those that have Amazon Prime. Makes watching your favorite shows and listening to music very easy. Magazines look great as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> As far as e-readers go this has to be the best experience I've had with one. Simplistic and ergonomic design allows you to fly through books.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought it in thanksgiving.its very cheap and has got good features for that.\n",
      "Positive :-> The sound from this unit is just incredible and with almost 20 million songs for $3.99 to $7.99 a month depending on the Amazon plan, it just doesn't get any better. Add in the fact it controls all the lights in my home, my Samsung robot vacuum and can answer almost any question I ask her, it is hard to imagine life without my Alexa...\n",
      "Positive :-> If you have prime membership, this is a must-have to maximize the benefits amazon offers to you.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fire tv works great no issues long as your internet is working good you will forget you are streaming\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Fire TV is very reliable and worth the price if you are a serious streamer I recommend it highly!\n",
      "Positive :-> Hy husband loves his kindle.the back light so he can read anywhere with low eye strain is awsome\n",
      "Positive :-> I transitioned from an unneeded iPad to this Kindle. The pages are incredibly clear, even during the day. However, you obviously cannot surf the web with this tablet. It's only for reading.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my nephew for Christmas and he hasn't put it down :) he loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best tablet in it's category at a price point which everyone can afford. Big thanks to Amazon for making this possible. The user experience is very good and there are enough number of apps to play around including the must haves like Facebook,Youtube ,Netflix etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> This box is on par or better than the competition when combine with Amazon Prime. 4 stars because I feel it's time the internals get an upgrade.\n",
      "Positive :-> Its comfortable to read, and it's compact. and light. I got case to go with it. I would recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the Echo great for all kinds of activities. I mostly use mine for the news and turning on the lights.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to use! Love that you could talk to it and take you where you want.\n",
      "Positive :-> Useful, fun and informative. Answers most questions quickly and the music/speaker is great. Caution: Alexa has really good hearing!\n",
      "Positive :-> It's really good for reading and for having a small tablet. To browse with.\n",
      "Positive :-> this is a great tablet for the price, works a lot like an ipad I would recommend it\n",
      "Positive :-> OTT= Over the Top digital television is the wave of the future for the TV industry. Amazon Fire TV is leading this revolution.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a 2 year warranty. If it breaks within 2 years, they replace it. My 4 year is very rough with things. My husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet, causing the charging port to break. I had no problems getting it replaced.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer.\n",
      "Positive :-> I havent played it at all but my son enjoys playing with his. Thats what it was meant for so I cant complain.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great gift for a young teen.tereat price. Terrific.\n",
      "Positive :-> After experimenting for several months with an Echo Dot, I decided to take the plunge when the Echo showed up online at a deep discount. Like the Dot, setup was easy. Sound quality is awesome. Sometimes it works too good as it listens to everything all the time. It’s going to be fun to use just the same.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent for someone who is alone at home and needs company. Very entertaining.\n",
      "Positive :-> This kindle is great, but it requires a cover to protect the screen - it's easily scratched.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Amazon Echo with Alexa. Very cool item. This one is going to be a house warming gift for a friend from college. I own two, and gave several of the Echo Dot's as Christmas gifts last year. The more you use it, the smarter it becomes. The price right now is EXCELLENT !!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to operate. It is a great size, and light weight. It is good for games, books, and pictures. I love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> comfortable to hold while reading, not easy to rotate.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have macular degeneration that makes it difficult for me to to read. The Paperwhite allows me to set the font size large enough to read comfortably and the great back lighting really helps also.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got them on every TV in the house. Fast internet is all you need\n",
      "Positive :-> This is s good inexpensive tablet that works well for young folks.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good tablet for your everyday used!!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use! Excellent content! Set-up is simple! Give as gifts.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the fire tv and it has a much faster processing speed than the fire stick, which I also own. I also like that the fire tv allows you to connect to all of my other accounts like Netflix, HBOgo, etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. Love that I can download Kindle Unlimited and read for $9.99 per month....a great savings.\n",
      "Positive :-> I own 4 Kindles and I love them all. Purchsed the new Paperwhite because it had free 3G just wish they would make the capacity larger\n",
      "Positive :-> Keeps my kids busy for hours the apps are excellent\n",
      "Positive :-> I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great item to have but a little more than the fire stick\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is nice for the price. Recommended for kids or an adult who doesn't need a large screen.\n",
      "Neutral :-> I Ive used this for a month now. It works great 75 percent of the time. Alexa doesnt always understand you. The mic doesnt hear you when your 20 feet away.\n",
      "Positive :-> A great buy as a second wife to my husband! She has all the answer without the smart mouth, she listen and most of all she shut's her mouth!\n",
      "Positive :-> My son love this tab and I recommend this. This is a great product.\n",
      "Positive :-> my 3 year old loves her kindle, Netflix and an abundance of games for her to learn from. Exceptionally easy to set up and use\n",
      "Negative :-> It was too slow he didn't put any attention to it. Battery didn't last.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my son after he broke his iPad, and I am so glad I did!! It has unlimited games and books, which has made such a huge difference in his desire to read!! Love love this tablet!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it! So much better than the model I had previously.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a nice little tablet, for me since I don't do a lot on a tablet, it's a great size. It took a little getting use to working with, but am a little more comfortable with it now.\n",
      "Positive :-> price is right easy to read books onlots of apps available\n",
      "Positive :-> What can I say, this is a great device that makes many home tasks easier and more fun!.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my gran as a Christmas gift. She plays games on it all day, checks her Facebook and loves it. Super easy to use. If she can anyone can.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this to replace a 2nd generation Kindle for my wife. She wanted it because of the backlight. The item exceeded her expectations. Great battery life too. I took he old kindle but plan to buy me one of these in the future.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is easy to use, economical, and perfect in size for a college student, but isn't good for HD my daughter said.\n",
      "Positive :-> Used to older format takes getting used to but good overall\n",
      "Positive :-> couldn't go wrong with the amazon tablet for $50 best deal there is only at Best Buy!\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the Amazon FireTV to access Playstation Vue, thereby reducing my monthly cost of viewing from $130.86 to $35 (other package viewing options available at affordable costs). The FireTV is 4K compatible providing a great picture with my 4K and non-4K TVs, no noticeable lag time with transition between channels or other options, and it can be used for cost effective/free streaming. I now have more very affordable viewing options than I ever had! I love the Amazon FireTV and would definitely recommend it to anyone!\n",
      "Positive :-> I enjoy moving night, and it kept becoming a hassle deciding what movies to watch, or what medium I would need to rent them. With the firestick, you have all the movies and shows at your disposal, which makes my life so much easier. What a great find. I am glad word of mouth helped me find this product, and would recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "Positive :-> I went back and forth for quite some time about purchasing the Echo. I watched many YouTube videos and reviews as well as reading a lot about the product itself. I finally caught it on sale and used to gift cards to buy it despite protests from my wife. I have to say Alexa is pretty intuitive and has no issues recognizing my voice. There are times when you have to word a sentence specifically but that is just a minor annoyance. Amazon has done a great job updating the Echo weekly and adding relevant skills such as package tracking and even flight status. I use it mostly for news, weather, shopping lists, reminders, movie times, timers, and occasionally some music. If you have any smart appliances then controlling them with Alexa is really cool. I only have a smart plug right now but it is great to walk in to a dark room and just ask Alexa to turn the light on or when you are about to go to bed and do not want to walk in the dark, just ask Alexa to turn the light off once u are there. As long as it is a reasonable distance of course. I admit it is a bit pricey so one should really look at their possible uses because I could see the novelty wearing off for some but for me it is a keeper.\n",
      "Positive :-> For the price, its really a nice little device....\n",
      "Positive :-> nice for this price................................\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent Picture, speed and overall quality. Movie selections range from 50's to date. UHD is the reason I made this purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> Have not had it long enough to give a proper review\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device, I have one, and purchased one for my mother. It's great for streaming things off amazon prime, but also good for downloading E-books.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too.\n",
      "Positive :-> I do like the camera. Sorry that is all I have to say.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this as gifts for my kids and other family then even myself. I wish I would have got this tablet along time ago.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought 7\" Kindle fire for my daughter to surf the web and watch videos. Bought 32GB microSD card, loaded videos and install apps there as the device only has 8GB RAM internal. This kindle has a known issue with not recognizing the microSD card sometimes, which requires pulling the tablet out of the drop-proof case (a pain), removing and reinserting the SD card until the tablet recognizes it. Time consuming and frustrating. Amazon doesn't seem too concerned with fixing this issue. It's minor really. Video playback is fine, but web surfing on the child's profile for educational sites is slow/sluggish. Not a fan of Amazon's ads all over the place and their app store is limited. For the price, hard to ask a lot. It'll serve it's purpose.\n",
      "Positive :-> The old one wouldn't hold a charge, but my new one goes days before running out of juice\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent gift for my grandkids. They love it and play with it all the time.\n",
      "Positive :-> i like the tablet only thing is im not a fan of the amazon app store. wish it had google play.\n",
      "Positive :-> This has a great UI. I've used all the different streaming devices and this is by far the cleanest, fastest, and offers a lot of app selections.Works great with Playstation Vue!\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is perfect and works flawless. I wish i got another one\n",
      "Positive :-> I wasn't sure I should buy it because I thought it would be a cheaply made tablet for $50 but I was wrong. I LOVE IT. It's worth it\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect tablet for the budget-minded. Obviously not as powerful or flashy as many other models, but at this price point, you can't go wrong.\n",
      "Positive :-> Other family member want same product...............\n",
      "Positive :-> Had a great experience with the product it has been fast and works great. I have enjoyed this product.I would recommend this product to any one. The price was even great price for our budget.Thank you for making it easy.\n",
      "Positive :-> bought this as a gift for my daughter who is very ill and has to be confined to indoors mostly and she loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> Great basic tablet for the money! Great for reading and surfing the web, only complaint is glare in bright sunlight.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it. Everything and more. Love to check the weather and play games\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a great addition to the family. Very simple to set up and to program. Once you understand the programming the set up is great!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great size, easy to use and it has a sleek look that is attractive.\n",
      "Positive :-> Thanks. We really like this tablet . It's easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> It is good device to have for reading, watching movie and surfing internet\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the learning games that he doesn't even realize they are learning games\n",
      "Positive :-> I tried a few Samsung tables they were junk and I paid 4 times the price for those. this out preformed them 10 fold and was 1/4 of the cost. Still not quite an iPad but for the price there is probably nothing better. Free time for the kids is a great feature.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's good to have this box if you like to watch tv series and programs other than spanish channels.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the ECHO so I wouldn't have to Google as much. It does have limits on certain info. but my grandson enjoys the games and quizzies.\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10\" version.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this gift for my dad he couldn't get it charged fast enough to play his poker games! Great price & so worth his smile on his face!\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased 2 of the Amazon Fire and I am very pleased not only with the product but the price was fantastic. The children are thrilled and they have found it very easy to operate.\n",
      "Positive :-> The voice control is great. Took some time to get used to installing skills and specific phrases.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for all members of the family to have fun with\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet on black Friday and I'm very happy with it. Haven't even touched my ipad since buying this little guy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good tablet for the money. A lot fast than I thought it would be. Bought 2 for gifts.\n",
      "Positive :-> My grandson can operate the kindle fire with no problem. Just the right size for his little hands.\n",

      "Positive :-> Its a quick fast little tablet. Can do a lot of stuff a normal tablet does.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was looking for a cheap tablet and i just love it is like having a a $200 tablet it works the same.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a gift for my Mother-in-Law and she's very happy with it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice Tablet, Easy to use and setup. This is most buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is now my BFF! LolShe keeps me company & entertains me with her jokes. Also reads my books & plays music without touching any button. Which I love the most especially when I am doing stuff around the house.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good product not a lot of junk built in and that's good for the fact that you can use that storage for the apps you really want.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my third kindle. I mainly bought this one so that I would be able to read on the beach.So far I really like it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was looking at several streaming devices and decided on the Amazon Fire TV. It was a great choice. The device is very fast and has no lag at all. It works great streaming 4k content from Amazon and Netflix to my LG 4k TV. I would highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> The 7\" amazon fire tablet has came along way since the kindle version. This is a full android tablet loaded with many great features. Price range makes it excellent for kids too.\n",
      "Positive :-> My son is 22 months and he love it. He watches his favorite shows.\n",
      "Positive :-> We got two of these tablets for my twins for Christmas and they are great. Using the parental controls plus the durability you cant beat the price. Also there have been not one issue with the tablet. Great inexpensive tablet for kids or anyone.\n",
      "Positive :-> Highly recommend. Easy to set up and Alexa is so much fun to use. Love her daily jokes and love to ask her to play any music. We bought a second one so that we don't have to keep moving her throughout the house.\n",
      "Positive :-> The echo has a great sound for a small product. The convenience alone makes this a worthwhile purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet is ok. It does display ads on the lock screen, that you can't opt out of, to my knowledge. But for the price, I can't really complain. I bought it at the $35 BF price. I wouldn't let me download Instagram for some reason either.\n",
      "Positive :-> The unit works well. The camera is not super High Resolution, but it is great to have front and rear cams. Access to lots of apps and email. It's nice to have the extra tablet around the house, and for $35?Child, please. Even at $50, it is a solid value.\n",
      "Positive :-> Quick delivery and works!\n",
      "Positive :-> Wow. I've had many tablets, but none come close to this for the price. The screen is clear and responsive. While it comes locked to amazon, i sideloaded the nook app without root, and then rooted it easily, just for fun. XDA has the details.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter...(who is 4.5 years old) for Christmas so that she can watch learning videos and etc on. This is a nice little tablet. I only wish we had things like this in the dark ages when I was a child!\n",
      "Positive :-> It works just right. My husband loves it too. It does well with my kids.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Not for the average computer person. Very confusing instructions. I spent several hours trying to install the \"overdrive\" so I could get e-books from the library. Ran the battery down several times with no luck. I got so disgusted I had to just put it down. (I'm still trying because I refuse to give up) Thinking about just returning it and the nice leather case too!)\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo is awesome! Hands free to listen to music, get weather and news. Amazing!\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought several of these and they work great! They are compact and lightweight. They have capability to add additional memory chips, too, to increase GB capacity.\n",
      "Positive :-> We purchased 2 of these for our children. They find them easy to use\n",
      "Neutral :-> I bought this to use only one application. Oh, is it most difficult to get this thing to continuously work! And I still can't get the geek squad program to properly download onto the device. I'm pretty disappointed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Now that we have begun to figure out how to use this, we are liking it much better. It didn't want to work well for us. When I called Amazon's help line, the person told me I couldn't get Amazon music if I was only Prime member. I had to get the premium package. I called again and got a more knowledgeable person and got it straightened out. At times Alexa has trouble getting things right. Learning curve.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this to lay on the coffee table for quick email checks and google searches. If you are looking for something to watch movies on or simple tasks, then it will do ok. Not a daily driver for sure.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very excellent product, I am very excited about using it!\n",
      "Positive :-> I've owned one of the original Kindle for years and love it. In fact I handed it down to my daughter. I just thought it would be nice to own the newest version with the built-in light. The other thing I considered was the weight. I love my new Kindle as much as I have loved my old one.\n",
      "Positive :-> Cheap tablet that pretty much does everything!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task.\n",
      "Positive :-> The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this table for my five year old daughter and she loves it. Placed parental controls on the tablet so she can't make purchases or search the web. Very easy to use and has great apps. May get one myself!\n",
      "Positive :-> It's awesome being able to have 4K capability and being able to play games but it does get laggy at times.\n",
      "Positive :-> I could plug into an Ethernet outlet for faster speeds than wireless. It works great\n",
      "Neutral :-> agood buy for starters, recomend to other buyers to\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this. So many apps and the quality is compatible with a 4k TV. The only thing is sometimes the apps freeze and restart sometimes. This doesn't happen often though.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very lightweight. Lots of features. Easy to read. Good software.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my Kindle, easy to use and works great! Would recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo is easy to set up. Alexa app was a snap to diownload. Use it for all my music, fitness, and thinks I want to learn about.\n",
      "Positive :-> my grandson had one and likes it. so i bought it for my other grandson\n",
      "Positive :-> Wanted a nice Reader, this is it for under $50!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> My 9 year old and 4 year old sons love this tablet for games and watching Netflix and Hulu. Great size for them. I like the parental controls and easy to monitor their activity and how much time a day they can use it. Was a great price and able to get one each.\n",
      "Positive :-> Ni problem at all. Run good easy to use. The remote very usefull\n",
      "Positive :-> Had older model, that you could text to speech, this one hasn't. Liked the smaller size, but having to buy a different cover! Still getting used to shelf quite different from my 4 year old model.Paper white is nice reading.\n",
      "Positive :-> I loved the variety of colors available for the tablet. It's been dropped a few times and thankfully is still in tact, with the exception of a few scratches. My son loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.\n",
      "Positive :-> It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device for children. Impressed by the specs.\n",
      "Positive :-> I enjoy listening to audible on it! Music sounds good and I like that it's so easy to set up and use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good tablet for only $30. My wife uses for apps such as Pinterest and Facebook and she loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> The teacher really likes this new tablet in their classroom!\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm no computer expert, so I appreciate how easy it is to use this tablet. Perfect for facebook, email, and online searches. It's fast and uncomplicated.\n",
      "Positive :-> Side loaded with kodi and loving no cable bill. Well worth the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's like having a radio (change the music you like) by telling it. Also,throw away your alarm clock,it does that too. Alexa,it's name, what's the weather forecast.. it does so many things. Like jeopardy, play it on the amazon.\n",
      "Positive :-> This a great product for the price. The amazon benefits alone would have made the an excellent deal... But this is a great low-end tablet as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like this thing I have it turning on lights in and out of the house it good for getting info about things it can do math it can hear very good and will play music from my Pandora account that's just a few things it can do.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product easy to set up and use my child loves it\n",
      "Neutral :-> The fire has a solid build, is not horribly slow, and has decent battery. Its major flaw today is the screen, which is both low resolution and poor contrast, with weak viewing angles. It makes a fine cheap tablet to hand to some kids though. For the price, not bad.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great gift for family and friends. I would recommend to my friends.\n",
      "Positive :-> No prob loved it highly recommend. Easy to transport. Great graphics.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it, only thing sometimes I gotta keep repeating the wake up name to get it started, but after that, it's great\n",
      "Positive :-> I recently purchased the Amazon Fire TV for use in a spare room. I subscribe to various platforms including Netflix and Playstation Vue. Although I am on a wireless connection, playback has been smooth, with almost no glitches. Not to mention, the picture quality has been superb (this can vary depending on the bandwidth of your internet connection). Setup was a breeze and it is very intuitive; so much so, that my 9 year old can use it with no problems (and after applying parental controls of course).\n",
      "Positive :-> As a standalone charger, this one does pretty good and I like the versatility to charge other items with the USB female plug vs. something hardwired that allows me to charge other USB-type devices in addition to something that uses a micro USB port.Charging time is faster for a Kindle Fire vs. my regular e-Ink Kindle charger, but since I haven't - and rarely - fully drain one of my Fires I cannot comment on the faster aspect for charging a Fire: I just know it works, and it does seem to charge my phone faster than the plug that came from Verizon. Thats not a shocker as this one is 9 watts vs. 5 for the normal charger.This is a replacement model to the original 9W PowerFast charger. Rather than the prior models square look this one is longer in a rectangular form and sticks out further from the socket. That seems to add more clutter to a wall socket. This years model also has rigid prongs (what you stick into the electrical socket) vs. the fold-down version of the prior model that gives it a lower profile. I didnt think too much of it at first, but the longer profile of the rectangular design, in addition to the electrical prongs not folding down into the charger, means it takes up a little bit more room in my laptop bag. Thats not good for me as now it wont fit in a side pocket for my brand of laptop bag and goes into the general pile of stuff that floats around in the main bag.19.99 seems to be a lot for an adapter of this power size, and it is: despite my comments on the changes above, the PowerFast chargers Amazon makes do seem to last. Ive never had one break as other brands do, I just keep leaving them in random hotels and airports while traveling and have to buy another! If you are looking for a solid and longer-lasting charger for your tablet, I would recommend this one.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have an iPad mini but it's impossible to see in the sun. I started thinking about getting a kindle while on vacation and trying to read a book at the pool. Damp hands,wrinkled pages - sunscreen all made the experience icky. I live the size, battery power, ease of use and you can see it outside.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great set top box with plenty of apps that will keep anyone engaged for hours!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a really good tablet for young kids that loves kids apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the backllit design! I can now read ANYWHERE!\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to hold and read in the evening without hurting your eyes. Love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Wonderful Tablet, Great buy, Easy to carry, I look forward to using this tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice, simple great deal for the money. Good buy, would recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> My uncle loves this tablet and its easy for him to use it, considering his age and lack of knowledge of technology devices.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product compact and easy to get around in. Was able to download almost all my favorite apps\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought three for my each of my grandchildren. They are 2,5,and 7. The 2 year old loves watching Elmo on the tablet and it's not too loud and the picture is very clear and colorful and she knows how to push the icons on the screen herself, the 5 and 7 year old plays car racing games as well as reading and math games. It has parental settings on the tablet so that I can assure that's it content is kid friendly. They love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is just what this avid reader needed!! Now I can read everywhere.. even in bright sun light!\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon fire t.v. is a great media system. Great alternative to the outrageous price of cable t.v.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fire tv loads faster than the stick. Works great with amazon prime.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product would recommend it this to others. Have a great picture.\n",
      "Positive :-> We can't get enough of it! We use it daily and even our kiddo can use it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Had the amazon dot but wanted the echo. Way better sound quality and responds much quicker. Very pleased with this purchase\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my daughter for christmas. I know she will like playing games on it\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet is great and works perfectly for any use\n",
      "Positive :-> I tried apple tv, chrome tv, Roku but I like this the best.\n",
      "Positive :-> This device works great and is capable of so much!\n",
      "Positive :-> This was purchased as a gift, but I now have the intention of purchasing for myself, because of how much they love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for one handed use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet to give to a teenager for Christmas. Expected them to use it for games, etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> I heart Alexa!! I use the shopping list app and use it to stream music all the time. My kids love asking it jokes and riddles. My only complaint is that I want a second one. Whenever I move it to a different room it can be a pain. It takes it a while to reconnect and it can be aggrivating. As long as I don't move it (unplug it) I'm fine!\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome I will definitely recommended this to anyone\n",
      "Positive :-> Very nice does almost everything I wanted it to do. Wish it's voice recognition was a little better.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to install, nice alternative to cable great shows on demand.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome product.. it looks great better than the picture.. It does what say and more.. very happy with the purchase\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my 3rd kindle and my 2nd kindle fire. I bought this fire because of the upgrade ability and my 1st fire didn't have that, Before I bought my 1st kindle, I compared all my choices and found this one to be the best for the money and I love my kindle so much I bought on for my daughter , It has a lot more then the original fire did, more Apps can be used, it connects to Goodreads, if you do that, which I do, and it has a camera. It's more like a tablet than just only a e-reader. A little different set up than the original fire but not that hard to get used to, buttons are bigger for the power and the volume, which is a plus.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought it for my mother-in- law. I am her favorite now she loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> I mean it's a great product for what you get, little on the expensive side\n",
      "Positive :-> Great 5 stars every home needs one. Just program it. Like it work for you\n",
      "Positive :-> Lightweight, perfect size. Love the built in light.\n",
      "Positive :-> this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it .\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use. I'm still playing around with it. Purchase it for my son.\n",
      "Positive :-> Quality of screen display is lacking and the reason I returned the tablet. For adult users I cannot recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really am enjoying the echo, it seems like I'm learning something new everyday, love to listen to my iheart radio stations on this\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a Christmas present for my niece, she loved it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazing. Works well. Everything runs quick and smooth and good price.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a very food tablet with its price. Very decent and affordable!0\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo is a great price of tech for the household. From playing music, controlling outdoor lights to answering numerous questions the kids have. So much Echo can do and they keep adding \"skills\" which are apps for it. No Brainer!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I brought this as one of the wished for items for our Adopt-A-Family. It appeared to be a nice device for viewing email, social media, and entertainment.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the Echo a lot. Mostly because of voice automation with Alexa. I've had my Echo Dot (from Best Buy too) since last November (about eight or nine months) and I like it for my bedroom, but the added speaker on the larger Echo device is much better for listening to news or music. If you turn on the \"start of request\" sound though, it's not as loud as the one on the Echo Dot, which is both good and bad. Either way, I like this device, and I'm glad I got it for only $100 with the added protection plan.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome tablet kids loved it they can't drop it they use it for games videos and homework\n",
      "Positive :-> Has options to add a scard that increases the low memory constraints on stick. Overall good\n",
      "Positive :-> I really enjoy the Echo. I got an Echo Dot and liked it so much I then got the full size Echo. I originally go the Echo Dot for the novelty thinking I wouldn't really use it very much but it turns out that I use them all the time. It is not something that anyone really needs but it is handy and a lot of fun. Some of the things it does really well: It's great at voice recognition - you seldom have to repeat yourself. Setting timers, reminders, and alarms is as easy as saying Alexa, wake me at 7 am Or Alexa, tell me when 10 minutes is up. If you are a Prime member the Echo is great at playing music from your music library or from Prime music. It's also great at playing radio stations (using tune-in and other apps). In the morning I'll say Alexa, play 680 WRKO to listen to Kim and VB on the radio. Some of the things the Echo is bad at: It's well known that it uses Microsoft's Bing search engine so most anything the Echo has to search for comes back with the response I don't know that. Being able to tell the Echo to use Yahoo or Google would make this a five star rating. Also, if you set an alarm or reminder it only reminds you on the device you specify or the one that hears you. For example, if I'm in the upstairs bedroom (location of the Echo Dot) and say Remind me to call John Smith in 10 minutes and then I go downstairs to the kitchen (location of the Echo), the reminder will only be in the bedroom. It would be nice if I could have an alarm or reminder set on both devices. The Echo Dot has the same capability as the full size Echo as far as I can tell. The only difference is the full size Echo has much better sound for music. That being said, the Echo Dot still sounds great, amazing really, for such a small device. But the full size Echo is like listening to a stereo. Again, these are well-made devices and are a lot of fun and very useful. Maybe not a necessity but they sure are a fun conversation piece with guests or grandkids come around.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for 1 reason to get back into reading books. It is perfect for that. Didn't really mess around with anything else.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon fire is so awesome I bought two one for myself and one for my daughter who also has an ipad but now she always has her fire tablet with her\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is way more fun and practical than I thought she would be. She isn't anywhere near as smart as OK Google, but she sounds a thousand times better and I'm really happy to have her.Shopping discounts, Hue control, music, scores, and weather. She'll even read your Kindle books to you. I find myself saying \"Thank You\" after she does something. And yeah, I asked her to marry me.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased Alexa since I have amazon prime. I decided I loved it so much, I bought 3 echo dots to put around my house. I love being able to talk to the air and have things turn on/off, order things on Amazon, play music, listen to the news. This device changed my life.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my Echo, great sound and feels like I have my own personal assistant..\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet thats ready right out of the packaging. It comes pre loaded with loads of apps and has a nice feel in the hands. screen quality is nice, the only thing i would like to see changed is the amount of time it takes the kindle to start up and shut down, it can get annoying at times. i have a 2 yo and 8yo and its held up great, dropped on cement and no cracks.\n",
      "Positive :-> Plugged it directly into my router for a faster connection and it works great\n",
      "Positive :-> It is very easy to set up and helps in delivering a better streaming experience. It was so good, I bought a second one.\n",
      "Positive :-> Makes a great smart home addition as it links to smart thermostats, lights, etc. Very informative and the different add ons are amazing! Highly recommended.\n",
      "Negative :-> Never knows answers to question or has the song I want. And always says not getting connection. It sucks\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is a very good tool to have in homes. The only thing is that sometimes we have to repeat questions.\n",
      "Positive :-> great for toddlers. I recommend anyone to purchase a protective case\n",
      "Positive :-> How can you go wrong? $40 for a tablet that you can use as an E-reader, to check social media, to play games on? Small enough to fit in your purse? Surf the web? And it's pretty fast. I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for an affordable tablet to use for basic things or for children who are rough on their toys. I plan to buy one of these for my mother who has an older iPad that is awfully slow.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love that there is a kids profile you can create on the tablet. Very user friendly.\n",
      "Positive :-> The sound is good and voice volume control is real nice. There are skills you need to find to do really so much. Learning what to say is getting better for me. I plan on buying a dot next.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for teens as well as adults who loves to read and watch movies\n",
      "Positive :-> my kids get a lot of use out of their tablets. however, I wish the battery life was better.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is great for using ebooks as a college student\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this to use Playstation Vue and it seems to be working well. I also use if for Youtube and Netflix. Quite a few reviews commented on the remote losing connection with the main unit but I have not had that problem.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my kids to play on. It fills that aspect great but the battery might last two hours of continuous use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have owned several Kindles over the years, and this one is the best yet. The contrast and clarity is improved over the already-good Paperwhite 2. I like the page turn \"buttons\" on the bezel as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Simple to use, a must own if you have Amazon Prime\n",
      "Positive :-> I love Alexa! She is so helpful to have in my everyday life, and so entertaining too. And I love her smart home connections; I can control my smart home with my voice through her. My only complaint is that you can't give her two commands at once, but it's easy enough to separate the commands.\n",
      "Positive :-> I needed something to read kindle books on and to watch occasional videos with. This inexpensive tablet packs a lot of features for a great price. Does everything I ask of it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a gift for a senior citizen that is not a fan of computers and technology. After just a few minutes of instruction she picked right up on how much fun she could have with her down loaded games and she also learned how to reach out on the internet for information on subjects that interest her. She is very happy with her gift!\n",
      "Positive :-> Still in the learning process--looking forward to more benefits!\n",
      "Positive :-> I really like them because I can get on my computer\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use, great screen resolution, and very simple to download material to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though.\n",
      "Positive :-> Absolutely love it! No problems with it at all and great battery.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a Christmas present. It was excellent.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Fire is excellent small compact, got it for my daughter's Christmas, she loves it. My daughter bought one for her grandfather which is 83 years old, he's doing good with it easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> blueray is just twhat I was I was looking for great for watching movies thank you\n",
      "Positive :-> For the price is great up to the minute on everything\n",
      "Positive :-> It is so fun to ask alexa and get an answer or listen to music which sounds great by the way. Very glad I purchased an Echo.\n",
      "Positive :-> works as described, but still needs some improvements such as more languages, more convenient menu... overall, it is one of the best TV boxes in the market now.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for the kids to have and play games on. They want put it down.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought to use with harmony hub to control tv and it does! Also very handy for things you used to have to look up on the internet - for example in the morning Alexa what is he weather forecast for today?\n",
      "Positive :-> So many great things to say. This product is awesome and can be configured to do so many things. I use it for my morning briefing of hot news, sports and weather. I also use her to turn on/off my theater system and NEST thermostat. Would highly recommend. Even the novice can configure and use this prodcut. You are only limited by your imagination. Just do your homework. There are many many automation options. You need to figure out the best brands and products for your lifestyle.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use it for listening to music when I'm trying to study. I use it to catch me up on news and also to turn off my lights. Great personal assistant wish it supported more applications/phone integration.\n",
      "Positive :-> Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.\n",
      "Positive :-> My wife likes it because she can read all different kind of books\n",
      "Positive :-> I was hesitant to buy the Echo, but waited until it was on sale. It's great for music and ties to Amazon Prime or Bluetooth to your phone. Unfortunately, it needs to be plugged in at all times to be powered on.\n",
      "Positive :-> PURCHASED THE FIRE BOX WITH THE INTENT OF GETTING A 4K TV.\n",
      "Positive :-> Same content but better. I wanted another one for my other tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> The integration to my home automation is transparent, I hope devices offered a way/skill to connect to all systems so I could have running amazon-google-apple-microsoft at the same between them.Amazon per what I researched was the best at my time of purchase, and it really makes it simple. It delivers on what they promise.\n",
      "Positive :-> The fire tv box is great, houses tons of apps and games. I like it so much I have a box on all four tv'shows in my house.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my wife, and she love's it. It's fast and very convenient!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my son as a bridge between phone and computer. Fits in perfect\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought 2 of these for Xmas kids love them great\n",
      "Positive :-> This a great add on for non smart (older) televisions with a USB port.\n",
      "Positive :-> The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought them for a 5 yr old and 7 yr old great for easy to use kid apps and learning games\n",
      "Positive :-> Good Christmas gift for a small time reader. Would buy again\n",

      "Positive :-> Excellent sound quality. Sleek and fun. Looking forward to using.\n",
      "Positive :-> I do not find this as easy to use as my original Kindle Fire but I do like the camera a lot better, though it is not clear megapixels\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Fire for my husband to play his games on. He enjoys it, but it's not as fast as he'd like.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best box. Really like it so far and having 4 k is nice\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my first android tablet. It works pretty good though don't expect it to work like an iPad. The ads are extremely annoying, but that's not Best Buy's fault.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not as good as before the old kindle, just seams to work better\n",
      "Positive :-> The kindle fire is a good little tablet. Good battery life, easy to use, just wish amazon would add the play store to their tablets but other than that it is a good tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is absolutely amazing helps with everyday needs\n",
      "Neutral :-> The only knock I have with this product is that it does not support vudu movie app. So...I have to connect to it through other means\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for children lots of great options to regulate what content that is available to the children.\n",
      "Positive :-> Gave this as a gift. Grandson loves it. We liked the low price.\n",
      "Positive :-> The battery life had been incredible. Fits in my wife's hands comfortably. She can't wait to get her next book.\n",
      "Positive :-> This kindle is great for reading in bright light, especially if you're on the beach. I recommend getting a case for it since it can scratch easily. Very lightweight and easy to carry. Price wasn't too bad either since it was on sale.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the third Vizio TV I've had, all still working, even after nine years of almost continuous service\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. As advertised. Very easy to set up profiles with daily goals and limits. Great purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> System over-all is fast and I mean for less that $50, its very reliable.The only downside, its uses almost 50% of the internal storage already, OS and built-in apps ... Should have settled for 32GB or more.Other than that, this toy is just ok :)\n",
      "Positive :-> this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play.\n",
      "Positive :-> Superb sound quality with deep bass and loudness, excellent voice recognition with noise cancelling. Lot of Alexa apps with integration with Logitech remote, Philips Hue home automation devices.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this product and that you can take \"Alexa\" everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker. You can connect it to your phone when away from a WiFi building. The speaker is great, it is surrounded by cloth, which I would worry about it getting dirty. The one downside to the tap compared to the Echo Dot or the OG Echo is that Alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the Tap, you have to press the speaker button. Pretty self explanatory name. You have to \"tap\" the tap. I ended up returning it to get the dot. But, like I said, great speaker, great portable device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for a Christmas present for family member, great value.\n",
      "Negative :-> You cannot download any other internet service you're subject to very limited options to do things on it wish I could not have bought it\n",
      "Positive :-> Great as expected great customer service. I've gotten this before and it's great\n",
      "Positive :-> Who needs a wife when Alexa does it all? She is a great listener.\n",
      "Positive :-> Research all the skills that Alexa has. You wouldn't believe what she can do.\n",
      "Positive :-> Pretty good tablet. Very durable and my son loves it, keeps him busy lots of game to choose from educational as well\n",
      "Positive :-> Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it with the remote. Smooth interface too. Huge plus if you have Amazon prime\n",
      "Positive :-> Works and recognized a lot of commands but doesn't work when the music is high.\n",
      "Positive :-> the performance is so much faster than my old one and the graphics are much better too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon added ads to this less expensive tablet. Annoying\n",
      "Positive :-> I never thought I would go tech for reading but the kindle has been a great addition.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this Fire for kids. It even comes with the bumper cover. Great buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> it was very easy to sit up and get it to working and plying games and down loading\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device. Good quality sound in a speaker. Super convenient.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have the echo and echo dot and use them all the time. I highly recommend them.\n",
      "Positive :-> A decent machine for the Black Friday price of under $40. The 8 GB of memory is inadequate if you play games using the Apps. I added a 32 GB micro SD card, but not all the Apps use it and the ones that do, only transfer part of the application to it. All points, coins, etc earned are retained in internal memory, not SD card. Pictures, videos, music can be stored on SD card. Screen is very sharp.\n",
      "Positive :-> Many hours of fun and entertainment in using the Echo. Always interesting what Alexa will share with you.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great! Use it daily for music. Like the sleek design.\n",
      "Positive :-> It took a bit for me to get used to the Kindle as I was used to reading the books on my phone with the Kindle app. I was a bit bummed with losing the color. I also dont like that it has no sound. Other than that it's a nice lightweight device with a good battery life. At first I thought it was defective because it froze up the first time I plugged in the usb. It actually stayed frozen for a couple days before it finally started working again.\n",
      "Positive :-> I think my Aunt likes her new toy. It is Amazing how technology marches on. This unit is perfect as an introduction to the tablet for people. Even if you have other tablets this is a wonderful addition because you can take it with you as if it's a throwaway. It has the slot to expand memory and the headphone jack has plenty of power and quality sound. It supports Bluetooth audio also. Any gadget freak should add this to their collection.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my amazon fire stick. It goes great with my tv!\n",
      "Positive :-> I recommend this device to all my friends. Endless capabilities from streaming your favorite movie to playing video games like grand theft auto. Buy it and add Kodi! You're welcome!\n",
      "Positive :-> I would go for the Echo because you can talk to it. The tap you have to touch it before you can talk to it. The speaker is good though for it's size.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for my 9 year old son... he loves it.... can do a lot more than expected.\n",
      "Positive :-> Its lightweight, amazingly bright color display and the best thing of all is you are granted access to thousands of books that are free from amazon/\n",
      "Positive :-> This is great for kids, it grows up with them, all the apps are good. My kid loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> It was easy to set up and we have loved using it, great for the whole family\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm used to a n iPad so I wasnt impressed with the kindle. I found it hard to navigate\n",
      "Positive :-> Great little device that does almost everything a Tablet does. I use it as my computer when I travel as well as a reader.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the Echo, want to buy other products to make home more compatible with alexa.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web\n",
      "Positive :-> If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Once you start to figure out all this will do , you will be very happy with your purchase\n",
      "Positive :-> I have a bunch of sticks but to be honest, I like the box better. Runs much faster and less buffering\n",
      "Positive :-> This is wonderful, no more lugging books around and you always have something to read and you never have to worry about finding a book or it being backordered. Should have bought this years ago! Great for anybody that loves to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the kindle fire. I have an I pad but I love to read on my kindle. The size is great, I like to read at night so my kindle makes it much easier. My grandson also plays games on it. It is a great product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for basic things or as an e-reader. My kids love theirs.\n",
      "Positive :-> the screen flush with the sides is great. The glass feeling is really nice. I don't use the side buttons for page turning but only because of habit. They are great and the need for pressure allows me to hold the kindle without changing pages. But, the price is painful. It is a splurge purchase since the paperwhite is just about as good in nearly every respect.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the size it fits right in my pocket and its not bulky\n",
      "Positive :-> Very pleased.Affordable price.Great buy.easy to manage.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a gift for my toddler grandson. He loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect e reader for beginners. My daughter is 9 and loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> It has good graphics quality and it is easy to use. Only complaint is when using the built in keyboard it doesn't always register they right keys.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got my FireTv box with kodi and is working awesome\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up and start using. Love having any type of music at the prompt of my voice!\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo has a better than expected speaker that plays music well. Hook it up to spotify through the alexa app and tell it what you want to hear.\n",
      "Positive :-> My son uses his tablet on a daily basis. He makes sure he has his case on it and can use all the apps. I can also use it and put on parental protections.\n",
      "Positive :-> While most avid readers will say that you can't match the physical qualities of a book as part of the overall reading experience, this is pretty convenient. The soft glow of the screen doesn't assault your eyes after an extended reading session, and it fits nicely in the hands too.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Kindle Paperwhite. It is very easy to operate and it holds plenty of books. It is easy to travel with. I would recommend it to everyone\n",
      "Positive :-> Gift for my sister and she is loving it!! Would definitely consider getting one for myself.\n",
      "Positive :-> Needed a present for mom, at first she didn't use it much cause she had to set it up but now it's great and she loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this so I can stream the playstation vue app and it works great. Very speedy and seems to be faster than the Roku 4. I would highly recommend this if you are trying to cut cords and want a set top box for streaming.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for my fiancé. She reads books with it,surfs the web, and watches Netflix on it. Very easy set up and easy to use. It also comes in different colors.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is awesome and my grandboy loves it. It keeps him from playing with my phone.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the 3rd fire in my family. This one was for my mother in law. The other two are my wife and my kids. These are easy to use and work well with Amazon as you would expect. I would recommend them as a starter tablet. I have used both Apple and Galaxy tabs and this one fits in well.\n",
      "Positive :-> This ereader is more like a tablet or iPad but without the huge price. Loving my new tech toy.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this as a second Kindle e-reader as well as an educational and leisure tablet. I also have a Kindle Keyboard; I thought that I wasn't going to enjoy reading on the Fire because of the back-light, but it is very adjustable and has a setting to turn the blue-light off for reading at night. I also wanted my kindergarten students to be able to use it educationally; it has a kid mode with great parental settings and an option to pay $2.99 a month for tons of awesome content!\n",
      "Positive :-> This little tablet is marvelous! I do not have a smart phone and this slips effortlessly in my handbag to be scanned at a store etc.. It's quick to respond and I can't say enough about it.\n",
      "Positive :-> great product used by all ages and everyone love it\n",
      "Positive :-> I have a kindle fire and love mine so I decided to get one for each of the grandkids. There are so many learning games that are fun for them plus you have parental control\n",
      "Positive :-> My Grandson love this tablet it's great for a 6 year old\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought 2 for Christmas. One for a 3.5 year old and one for a 2 year old. It works well for them and if they trash it I'm only out $50 for a replacement.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy setup and better control than ipads. Pleased with performance.\n",
      "Positive :-> I always buy iPads because I am an Apple fanboy, but these tablets (I bought several) have been great for the price and for what I want them for and that is to entertain kids at my business. These are much more affordable than iPads if your just playing games on them.\n",
      "Neutral :-> I have two amazon fire sticks. They were nice but kind of slow. Got this amazon fire tv box heard it ran faster which it does but the remote dies faster... A little over 30 days of course after the return period the remote sizzled. Good thing for the remote app.\n",
      "Positive :-> I would give this tablet great recommendations for anyone to buy it. We purchased for family members in Mexico and they love i. Easy to use. Great buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> The kids really enjoy this tablet. This tablet is built well\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product, works as described. Has a lot of apps to choose from. One downside, I had a 2010 LG tv and the tv was too old to use the Amazon Fire tv. The Fire tv requires the tv to be hdcp 2.0 compliant. Many older tvs are not and won't work on them. Make sure it works before purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> Its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet if you are looking for one thet doesn't cost alot. Amazon has a nice app market as well\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my third Kindle and I love them! The advantage to this one is I can read it easily with no other lights on.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price for a tablet.Bought this for my father\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my third Amazon Fire tablet, and it is definitely an upgrade from my two-year-old 7-inch Fire HD. I love that it has a card slot and both front and rear-facing cameras.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased as a gift for my 83 year old mother. It proved to be simple to use. She is very comfortable using the device and the option for large screen print has given her back the joy of reading.\n",
      "Positive :-> For years I have used my very basic Kindle e-reader, but had difficulty in dim lighting. I am thrilled with the backlit screen on my new Kindle Paperwhite.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire has a fast interface and offers all the services you would expect from a streaming box. The Playstation Vue app actually works better on my Fire than on my PS4.\n",
      "Positive :-> we had an older model from 2012 and it broke so we just replaced with newer one. Love the new features.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very very beautiful design...and very good sound..great quality.........like it..!\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love the Amazon Echo. It was by far one of my best purchases. It can sync with nearly everything, and on top of it you don't need to get off the couch or out of bed to use it. It recognizes your voice and answers right away, without delay. I would recommend this for anyone!\n",
      "Positive :-> No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the third one in our house. It's great for book reading, surfing the web and checking emails\n",
      "Positive :-> acts up a lot , but has a lot of good features. but then again i should go over the instructions.\n",
      "Positive :-> I upgraded my mother's 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8\" and is much faster.\n",
      "Positive :-> Enjoying my Alexas! We have multiple Alexa's and dots around the house and garage!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for Amazon Netflix etc... Even better for more advance users Kodi!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the ease of speaking to Alexis, she understand voice request even in a noisy room and she is able to distinguish between my voice and TV or radio. She can instantly fill most request for music and info and I love the stages when you set an alarm. I am a bit concern that she is not loyal to just my voice and anyone around her can input to her and override my music or commands\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this little kindle. It's necessary to take advantage of your Amazon Prime membership. With that membership, you get to read, every month, one their amazon unlimited kindle books. To take advantage of that aspect of your prime membership, you have to read these books on your kindle, and can't be accessed on other android tablets. That's 12 books to read for free a year. Best of all, mine was on sale for $39.99.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this tablet for my 5 and 7 year olds!!! They have tons of kid friendly games that keeps them busy for hours\n",
      "Positive :-> The kindle fire kid is easy enough that our 2 year old can work it!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hards off the unit.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product\n",
      "Positive :-> The paperwhite model has a very clear screen and backlight so I can be used in most lighting conditions. The manual is an ebook which not everyone will be fond of. My only complaint is that it includes a USB cable but does not include a charger in the box. Luckily I had a number of appropriate chargers that work well with the reader. Compared to the more expensive models, the Paperwhite had the functionality that I was looking for at a reasonable price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Yes perfect for a bonus room can have Netflix and movies all at the same time\n",
      "Positive :-> We only use Alexa for music and are glad we purchased the larger speaker.\n",
      "Positive :-> First, bought it 15 days before it went on sale everywhere. Next, store doesn't tell you about all the ads offers that come with it and you must pay $15 to disable them. Performance is slow; keypad is slow, am typing faster than it can register resulting in lots of typos. Watching movies is decent, but sound could be better. It drops WiFi more than I'm used to. Have several apps that cannot be installed on it and a few that consistently crash. Good battery kifre, but Quite slow to recharge. Sometimes the \"keys\" stick and can't get out of something even with home key, must restart. Thought this would be cheap temporary solution but this is better served by my 5 year old grandson.I got $50 worth of tablet.Compared to the look and feel of my old iPad, its like I'm still using a VCR and everyone else is on blue ray.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 2 one for each one of my daughters and they both like them.\n",
      "Positive :-> had a problem with my purchase, but Best Buy made it good, they are very good!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this item for a kid and she love it,, best of all the color make the product well like able, She claimed that it is fast and the parent is able to set up parental control.Parental control help parent to monitor activity easily\n",
      "Positive :-> The amazon tablet is priced amazingly. However, the tablet needs to be restarted constantly to find a WiFi connection.\n",
      "Positive :-> My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it this is so much better then paying for cable TV there's so much to see you can see and even have to pay extra for it to view movies\n",
      "Positive :-> They loved it and are always talking about their gift .\n",
      "Positive :-> The kindle is the best ebook reader. I love it and use it daily.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is great not just for adults but also kids. After having this tablet I'll never go back to a different brand.\n",
      "Positive :-> So far the echo has been great...but there is a limited amount of skill and a lot of them are very useless. Once I add the accessories tonmake my home \"smarter\" I can get more use out of it. The speakers are incredible. Hope to have one or a dot in more rooms.\n"

      "Positive :-> This was an affordable device that allowed me to play music while at work. It also does quite a bit more, but this was my use of the product. It was less expensive than the iPod.\n",

      "Positive :-> But, fast forwarding through content can reset the cursor and put you at the beginning of the content. And, occasionally can get you out of the application. Perhaps additional memory in a future version of this product may fix this. However, watching subscription free content is always a treat.Good solid product. I also own Roku and its interface slightly easier for elderly and those with not much patience.\n",
      "Positive :-> I always liked reading books in physical form, but it just got to hard to carry around. Plus, my bookshelf was too full. This solves both problems!\n",
      "Positive :-> Thought it would be fun to have one after reading the reviews. My alarm clock went south and I was shopping for a new one.

      "Positive :-> I have waited to purchase a Tablet - when the Kindle Fire came on sale I decided to take advantage of the sale price. So far this has been a very good purchase for what I intend to use the Tablet for. E-mail, Facebook, News and BOOKS to read. Easy to use and have enjoyed this product.\n",

      "Positive :-> I like to get library books, but just have a super hard time getting them on my Kindle. I finally get it done, but it is such a task because I don't know what to do. Other than that, I really like the Kindle as I can read in bed without turning on the light and I can also read outside in the sun. How great is that!!! I love it. Now, I just need to read how to accomplish the chore at hand---getting library books.\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love this tablet,with a price you cant beat!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought one for myself and my younger sister. If you don't want or NEED to spend a couple hundred on an Ipad or something like that, This is a really good deal. I enjoy using it a lot, and so does my younger sister. Doesn't have all the fancy things the more expensive ones do, but it's not bad for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Using this with Playstation Vue for TV and HBO Now. It works great!\n",
      "Negative :-> We bought WowWee MiP robots for our grandsons, 8 and 11 years old. They don't have iPad or iPhone in their home. So thoroughly researched what else would work for installing the app. Talked with Best Buy salesperson, who said the app could be loaded via the app store (it can't).Kindle Fire 2015 is included on the WowWee \"compatibility\" list. So we bought them each a brand new Kindle in order to use the app. They had Kindles from earlier years, but these wouldn't support the Bluetooth functionality needed for the robots.ABSOLUTE FAIL. We tried EVERY possible configuration (adult vs child Amazon accounts; Bluetooth on first or off first; MiP on first or off first; etc). It never worked at all ~ not even once.Also tried full factory reset on each device, loading the app via a Google Play account, rather than Amazon Kindle account. Google Play wouldn't load the app; said it wasn't compatible with this Kindle device.Opened a ticket on WowWee. The response was that they've had the same experience - the bluetooth on this Kindle fails and so the app doesn't work with the WowWee robots. They admit it fails, yet it's still on their approved list.So this was an absolute waste of money, tho at least the boys can play some free games we loaded for them.\n",
      "Positive :-> Compared to an equally inexpensive RCA tablet, this one has more limitations in the apps you can get. I was disappointed in its utility and prefer the RCA tablet over this one.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two one for my son and one for me. Great tablet, at a reasonable price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome\n",
      "Positive :-> Makes watching Netflix shows at home easy if your tv doesn't have wifi capabilities.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is great for e-reading and basic internet use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Answers just about any question, spells words, plays a boat load of songs although some songs require additional membership. Love it and would suggest to all\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tab for my mother. I felt it was a great Christmas gift. She was very exited to see it and actually thought to get one. I might buy one for myself.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.\n",
      "Positive :-> We are very happy with this Kindle. Easy to use, user friendly. We like everything about it, it's exactly what we wanted.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this tablet for my mom as an additional after X-mas gift. She likes the clean/simple/no fuss/etc. way a tablet works, ie, no keyboard/mouse/etc., just your fingers for input.\n",
      "Negative :-> Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK\n",
      "Positive :-> An excellent tablet for such an affordable price!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I was even able to get the Google play store on it. Returned though since there was no option to leave the display always on.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Tablets are the best out there and at the best prices. Full tablet functionality and access to all the Amazon media. Can't lose with these tablets.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product and works very well with no buffering on wifi.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for my daughter in the car. I didn't think I would like kids mode, but I hands found it to be useful. Amazon tweaked android and not for the better but it is still manageable. All things considered this is a cheap tablet but for a kid who cares.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Slow, advertisements on home screen are annoying can be stopped for a fee\n",
      "Positive :-> They came out strong with there best foot forward. Love it and use it daily\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had the amazon fire tv for about a month now and I think it's solid. I had the apple tv for about 3 years before this and compared the amazon fire to the newest apple tv when I made this choice. The services I use (netflix and hulu plus) were available on both but since I am also a amazon prime member and the shows are generally cheaper via the amazon store I chose the fire tv. The set up was easy and I like the user interface. The system response is snappy compared to the older apple tv but I am noticing a bit more random resets and freezing with the fire tv. I suspect it's software related and can get worked out with updates. I think it's solid and would recommend the fire tv to anyone asking.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice sturdy case. Good way to start children on tablets.\n",
      "Positive :-> Unbelievable price, and everyone loves it (I Bought 6 for gifts)\n",
      "Positive :-> Already own one, loved it so much, bought as a gift for my mother-in-law for Christmas on Black Friday for $35! Can't beat that!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have wanted a Kindle reader for a few years now & I'm so happy to finally have one! It's so convenient, easy to hold, & most importantly it's easy on the eyes even when I don't have my glasses!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 2 fires for my children and they were a great purchase. They aren't expensive and they are easy to maunuver through even for kids. They love them.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire TV box definitely connects faster when using for streaming well worth the money at Best Buy.com definitely recommend it. No buffering, Stable!\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome speaker, love that I can talk to it and it responds well\n",
      "Positive :-> I previously purchased two of these for two other grandkids and they just love them and so does mom. She can set time limits, can limit access, and much more. Plus it comes with a two year guarantee , if the child breaks it, they will replace it. Did I mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity. These grandkids are 4 to 8 in age, but older kids would enjoy this also.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to work no issues my daughter loves it and my 6 year old loves it too\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the item for my goddaughter and she loves. Easy to use and durable. Reasonable price and great features\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> My 8 year old is required to read for 20 minutes a day for school. Something about reading on an electronic device excites and he is willing to read without a fight. Great purchase for us.\n",
      "Positive :-> Just as advertised. Bought for my mom who has poor eyesight. She loves it. Thank you.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for games and reading. Price was great. Great battery life. Well worth the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great, sound is clear and is really loud. Would recommend\n",
      "Positive :-> After ranting against e-readers for years, I decided that I could use one for the long bus trips into and back from work. Tablets gave me eyestrain, and one of my brothers (who happened to have the same problem with tablet-reading) suggested doing what he did and getting a Paperwhite.This thing is amazing! I am now a firm believer! The simplicity of its controls, the portability, and Best Buy's 2-year extended warranty have made this something I ALWAYS carry with me!\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a little bit heavier then I expected, especially if you hold it for long. And I don't really like the flash when changing pages...Yet, it is much better then iPad or mini if you are reading an e-book. I bought it for my pregnancy cause I can read books while breast feeding~\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is the perfect portable size for me.It's connectivity with other devices is great and i can use it for a lot of fun disractions during my free time\n",
      "Positive :-> The battery life is pretty good and the best feature in my opinion is the expandable memory slot. It allows me to store all of music so I don't have to use my phone and get a call in the middle of a party\n",
      "Positive :-> GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to use and to set up. All you need is a tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 5 year old loves his tablet. It's perfect for him.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to replace my Nook since it was such a great deal..it did not disappoint. Great graphics sharp fun games and free apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am extremely satisfied with this e-reader. It makes for ease on the eyes and fits comfortably in my hands.\n",
      "Positive :-> OVERALL, HAVE LOVED ITEM, EASY TO CARRY AROUND AND USE.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great interface, 4K and below output. It is well worth the money! Has a multitude of well made apps, and is a well designed unit. Easily upgrade able via a micro SD card!\n",
      "Positive :-> Gave as Gift. the recipient powered down his IPad, and is giving it away.\n",
      "Positive :-> Upgraded to this from the Fire TV Stick, it's twice as powerful than the stick. I liked it a lot and got 3 of my coworkers on them and they love it. Great for travel, a dorm room & for not paying on extra cable/satellite boxes and their monthly vig.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fixed problem after several power bumps/outages even with surge protector. Happy spending cost for new power adaptor vs. new Echo\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Is easy to use, great to look up words you dont know as you go along.Its also great that the light isnt shone up into your eyes, it makes it so that they dont get easily tired and they dont hurt.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great to use and I like the larger screen. It is fast and easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> great for listening to prime music, quick weather reports. volume adjusts quickly and gives status of battery on request.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product, I bought one last year and loved it. Had to buy another for the guest room. Having Alexa makes it even easier to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very lightweight! Just as nice as the next one up that you can only buy online. Would recommend this to all my friends and family,\n",
      "Positive :-> From latest news flash, to weather info, to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for Alexa to set a timer, the Amazon Tap is a fun tool to have around the house!\n",
      "Positive :-> We love having the echo in our home. Was going to be a Christmas present but we couldn't wait to use it. We like it so much we even took it on vacation with us. The shopping app is great. Jokes are pretty funny. She's great at history and I never miss my morning report!\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is quad core CPU and has plenty of space for you to download more apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's great to be hands free..just ask alexa to add to shopping list or play specific music..nice sound .. no typing required ... Love it\n",
      "Neutral :-> The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am extremely thrilled with my Amazon Fire Tablet. It is definitely worth its price!\n",
      "Positive :-> Good products I would advise every one to get one it work great and easy to install\n",
      "Positive :-> brought it as a gift for my uncle and its a decent tab for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet. My last tablet was a Nexus (a gift) which did not really impress me. The Fire tablet has everything I need to keep myself entertained when I am on the go or recovering from a busy work week.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the second Kindle Fire 7 we have purchased. This unit was purchased for my wife because she wanted to take pictures and share with family on social media. Compared to another tablet we own, this is by far more superior in quality and performance.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well and fully functional. I would recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got it for my god son and he loves it .it's east use to\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a lot cheaper than other tablets with all the functions I need.\n",
      "Positive :-> Snagged it on sale for $39.95. Then got another discount from accumulated BB points. It's not HD, but I don't find that necessary on a small screen. I like the form factor, fits into coat or jacket pocket. Amazon app store lacks the number of apps of Google store but there are easy ways to install Google apps store. While you can use it for productivity tasks with a compatible keyboard I bought it for my wife to watch youtube and netflix shows on a bigger screen than her iphone. Its wireless signal pickup distance is a bit weak, but the ability to add storage via micro SD is nice. Even at $50 it is a good buy for what it is.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am now able to stream tv and movies from around the world, works great.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Fire pad is a great deal for the price. It works great very responsive, does exactly what I want it to do like Netflix, Google and a few games. It doesn't suck :)\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a great product would buy another one soon .\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet about a month ago, have enjoyed it every since! I would truthfully say it is one of the best.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my grandson, fits his hands just right. Love that i could buy and sdcard to enlarge the memory. He loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I already had a kindle paperwhite but wanted to upgrade a bit\n",
      "Positive :-> Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.\n",
      "Positive :-> My friends kids loved them. Perfect for kids 6 and up. Would def. recommend\n",
      "Positive :-> My son is 3 and he loves it so easy to use. It's great.\n",
      "Positive :-> The battery lasts very long. This saves me so much space at home!! I take it with me everywhere gym, work, long trips!! Very happy with my purchase...\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought to use with PS Vue, no issues so far. Would be nice to be able turn it off when not streaming.\n",
      "Positive :-> It has many uses. You can listen to music, check the weather, listen to podcasts and music. You can also use it as an alarm.\n",
      "Positive :-> Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.\n",
      "Positive :-> I loved the first one I bought so much I bought another one for my bedroom. This has replaced the Chromecast which I had on all my TVs. My house is wired with Cat6 and I have a fast internet connection and streaming from Netflix is almost immediate.\n",
      "Positive :-> We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Item was plug and play after connecting to wireless router. Add 16g SD card to improve buffering.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is very easy to read and just the right size and weight to carry.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet for my nephew and he loved it ! Easy to set up and easy to use !\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product if you don't want to spend money on iPad. Great just for surfing internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this on thanksgiving! It was super cheap and I'm glad they had it in stock!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use one of these in every room of my house with a TV. No more cable bills and I get to watch what I want when I want.\n",
      "Positive :-> I enjoy using the Echo to tell me a joke, stream some music or answer a question. I find it useful for setting timers, alarms or turning on/off lights.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my nephew and neice. Off the charts!!! They're learning at an ecellerated pace.\n",
      "Positive :-> always learning new things that it can do to make my life easier! if the speaker was just a little louder it would have gotten 5 stars.\n",
      "Positive :-> Does exactly what you wanted to, very nice looking seems to be a solid product\n",
      "Positive :-> Wasn't sure about getting this or the fire stick, but read this works a lot better. Glad i purchased this.\n",
      "Positive :-> I needed this for my two six year olds to be able to use during our drive to Disney. You are unable to get most apps that are offered on iTunes and android market so I returned.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had my eye on the Echo for a few months now. I didn't realize Best Buy had got them in stock until I was discussing with the sales person. I decided to give it a try. Set up was so easy. The voice recognition has been excellent. Alexa hears and appropriately responds to all of my requests, as well as my husband's. It really comes in handy in the mornings, as I can request news and entertainment while getting ready for the day. I can review my daily schedule, adjust it, make lists and so much more. Integration with IFTTT works great. The amount of easily available content is wonderful. While I don't have any smart devices such as lights or thermostats yet, I am planning for them, and will be able to use the Echo to control them.\n",
      "Positive :-> My new Fire tablet is easy to navigate I have had two other brands and my fire is the best .\n",
      "Positive :-> I wanted a simple device strictly for books. I did not want pop up pictures or current events running across the bottom of the screen. This is the tool for me. I keep one at home and one in the car for wait times at appointments.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire is very much so as it's slogan suggests, a sensible tablet. Inexpensive and versatile, highly recommend\n",
      "Positive :-> It works like it's supposed to. Use it for charging my new Kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this!! It makes it very easy to listen to music and find topics of interest and places to go.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the tablet for my nephew for Christmas. He loves it!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7\" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can).\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for my 10 years old daughter. She loves it and that makes me happy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price on a good tablet... especially on Black Friday\n",
      "Positive :-> i love the speaker sound and that I can talk to Alexa and ask her anything.\n",
      "Positive :-> i got this kindle for xmas. simply lovely. i would strongly recommend you to get one\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for my wife she loves it and I would but one for my self too\n",
      "Positive :-> Good item and also good price. My son and I like this!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely LOVE my kindle paper white. I read a ton of books and love having all of them with me at all times\n",
      "Positive :-> Great features. Very smooth operating system. Better than Apple TV in my opinion\n",
      "Positive :-> It is the top of the line e reader by amazon which is also the leader in e readers. The voyage is an excellent device and very versatile to carry on your trips. I feel the premium for the page turn sensors is little too high. In hindsight I would go with the paper white and save a few bucks.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this as a gift for a friend who really just wanted to have a device to play games. It was perfect for him. He can do so much more with this tablet. It is a great tablet for the price!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this because I went Amazon Prime and even thought I had an HD TV, Xbox one, PS4 and even my computer i still had problems with Amazon video playing in HD. Magically after purchasing Fire TV the problems disappeared. Way to go Amazon! I bought this over the fire stick because I can add memory. It works great, and the new menu is easier to navigate. I'm not 100% on if it's worth it or not(prime and fire tv). It's like all these streaming services thousands of old videos many b movies that no one cared to watch when they came out. But as a product it works. It's easy to use. And if you like talking to your devices this will be fun for you.\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm enjoying using this, though it occasionally can't understand me, especially during the word game. I love asking for music, any kind, and have it play. I love that I can use it to set alarms, to ser time limits, to ask the weather and to have Alexa tell me corny jokes. Recently I purchased the wifi plugs, but I haven't set them up yet.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Echo is great. Good speakers, works as advertised.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is easy to install and upgrade. Love the clarity\n",
      "Positive :-> I have three amazon products this as well as a kindle and fire stick. This fire TV has the advantage because of the ethernet port. Offers Fox Go for the Yankees but still no TWC compatibility which is why it gets 4 stars out of 5.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have both the fire stick and the fire tv, the fire tv is much faster considering the processing power.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best investment made. I use this daily for reading and doing light work.\n",
      "Positive :-> So far it is working well, it does answer some questions, but not as far advanced as your I Phone does yet, however I have confidence that the Echo will be be continually learning as Amazon upgrades it.\n",
      "Neutral :-> This product works, but works slow compared to Apple and some Android phones/tablets. Like I stated in my summary... you pay for what you get. No major issues thus far.\n",
      "Positive :-> We upgraded to the 4K version. It has better buffering, and we love the voice search capabilities on the remote. It is super simple to set up and start watching your favorite programs. It also let's you add external apps like Kodi. Well worth the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use. Memory fills up fast though. Battery life is decent.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use it every day. 4k shows like the Grand Tour look impressive. Set up is easy.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a present for my mother in law who is 70 for Mother's Day and she loves it and I was worried she might not. Now I'm going to probably get one for myself!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I was skeptical of such a low price point tablet. My children broke a more expensive tablet that I owned and I needed a replacement. I absolutely love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well and easy to use. This is a great Camera for the price\n",
      "Positive :-> Slightly slow. However, really good for the price. Also... these Amazon tablets don't use the normal google app store... they use the Amazon app store, which is not as extensive as the Google App store. This can be a significant drawback.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you aren't tech savvy, know someone who is to be able to get Alexa to respond. Amazon was kind enough to email me to offer support; I'm afraid the first question will be, \"Is it plugged in?\" I'm not tech savvy, but I also have some sense.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for the price. My nieces loved it ...\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for the kids, play games, surf the web, AWESOME , 5 STARS !!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased two tablets for Christmas gifts and they were great!\n",
      "Positive :-> I find Alexa to be extremely useless at times. It's a chore trying to search for specific music through Amazon's music list (this is trying to find common songs played on the radio currently)\n",
      "Positive :-> I enjoy having the tablet when I am travelling. Great size.\n",
      "Positive :-> works and is light\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a good kindle for the money. to much junk on the carousel\n",
      "Positive :-> I prefer this than anything else out there. It might be because I am partial to Amazon and its service.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my daughter as a birthday gift and she fell in love with it. She loves the feature to buy from Amazon without lifting a finger.\n",
      "Positive :-> Its like a personal assistant. Alexa saves time, I don't need to go my phone or laptop. I just ask! Its amazing! Love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet, got it on black Friday for my daughter and it was only $39. Works well, no problems. My daughter loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great little tablet for what you're paying for it! Gets everything done that I need it to\n",
      "Positive :-> I enjoy it very much. It works good and does what it is supposed to do\n",
      "Positive :-> The box is better than the stick must have for anyone that likes to stream\n",
      "Positive :-> Didn't know how many lingering questions I had until I got an Amazon Echo. I mean, every little thing I want to know, I now just ask and hope Alexa knows. Very helpful to just get a quick answer to most things.\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet is good and great for younger kids free download\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loves this tablet. We purchased it for her for Christmas. I found a great bumper case on Amazon and very cheap. This was an awesome deal!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love how light and battery life. Awesome!!! Would recommend anyone to buy this device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Luv the tablet and reading the books resolution is great\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon echo is simply an amazing product. I was able to set it up in minutes. In addition to all of the normal stuff you see on TV commercials it also integrates well with with all of my existing gadgets (Nest thermostats, Rachio sprinklers, Fitbit, Security system, Harmony remote hub, etc through IFTTT. My wife loves watering her flowers outside just by asking Alexa. The only thing I am really mad about is that it's now $20 than I bought it from Best Buy 4 days ago.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this to use while I travel because you can connect to Wi-Fi that has a webpage for signing in, like pretty much all hotels require. It was awesome for about two weeks. At first it worked fine with my brand new awesome Samsung 4k tv, then a week later the tv didn't even recognize it. Apparently it doesn't pay nice with Samsung. Not a huge deal since I bought it for traveling, then it didn't display correctly on the hotel tv, it was just a tiny piece of the picture and it was jammed into the top corner and the rest black. The next hotel, it looked fine but there wasn't any audio. COME ON. Really stinks.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet good size and very easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> My son is obsessed with his kids kindle!! A must have so they stay off your phone !\n",
      "Positive :-> The Tap has been wonderful! We use it as a timer, for a weather update and for general music. The sound is terrific. I would recommend this unit. It is certainly easy to use - just a tap away.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the unit. Great sound! Good general news available. Only thing negative is it has to remain plugged in to operate.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fun to play with, a great source to gather information from without cracking a book.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this thing runs my lights .The shoping list and to do list is very handy\n",
      "Positive :-> Works as expected.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for my 4 and 8 year old.... kid friendly, safe, and mom and dad enjoy it as well! Love that it comes in a protective case. Reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love having this item in the house. It makes life easier when walking into a room with a hands full of a laundry basket or groceries, etc\n",
      "Positive :-> Just as good as amazon suggests it to work. I use ut every day\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent Product & Highly recommended. Excellent!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love everything about this item. I can watch whatever, whenever, particularly on Kodi. Good bye and good riddance to cable!\n",
      "Positive :-> Responses well and there are lots of skills to be added for increased function.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great option for my office to make use of my Amazon Prime membership. Better if it had a browser but the voice option Alexa is wonderful. Search app option is welcomed. I may add the game controller soon.\n",
      "Positive :-> There are a few things that needs correcting but overall I love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have apple tv and this thing is way better. I do have prime.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second fire reader. I like how compact it is and also that can add sim card which I have. Only negative is I wish the battery life was a little better.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for beach and night reading. Easy to use and change fonts and light.\n",
      "Positive :-> need more expects on tablet & computer with nohow.\n",
      "Positive :-> Before the Echo we played music often for our toddler via Pandora on the Amazon Firestick. I am generally not an early adopter for the newest technology, but with a 95% music use case in mind and to experiment I pulled the trigger and bought one. Within a week I subscribed to the single-device option for Amazon Music Unlimited at a cost of 3.99/month after a free 30-day trial. Now we rarely use Pandora due to the expansive Amazon selection. I also upgraded to a smart thermostat and am looking into Philips Hue Color lighting. My experience has been positive enough to also buy an Echo Dot with Harman-Kardon Onyx Mini speaker for my parents. While great, however, there are opportunities for improvement:1. Sometimes Alexa fails to find a selection which it succeeded at before. I made sure my command was identical and clear.2. The suite of skills is weak and mostly pointless. I only use the news flash, weather, and traffic.3. Search functionality for facts/answers is limited and based on reviews is likely worse than Google Home.4. There is no integration with the Firestick/ Fire TV which is surprising. Currently one must buy a Logitech Harmony hub to do so.5. Alexa struggles to find certain classical pieces even though I have confirmed them to be available on Amazon Music. Part of the problem might be the many versions which exist for a given piece as well as the distinction between composer and performing artist.Overall, I would recommend this product especially for those who listen to a lot of music, but don't expect perfection quite yet!\n",
      "Negative :-> I'm writing a review based on the problem I had with my Kindle HD 8.9 it would not hold a charge even though Amazon try to reboot it from their location or had to technician try to reboot it but it wouldn't come on so I'm just want to say that the charger does work when I plugged it into my Samsung phone with the power cord so that's why I give it 5 stars\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice price for all you get great product all best buy employees\n",
      "Positive :-> Very satisfied so far. Easy to use and great price\n",
      "Positive :-> We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great and nice links to Amazon if you have a prime account.\n",
      "Positive :-> Does everything we need. Light and portable. Bought 3 and no complaints.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is great for the beach or by the pool. If you already own an Echo, this is a great addition to the household.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like it my wife use it everyday to does what it say\n",
      "Positive :-> The screen size could be bigger like the earlier versions of kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for little ones who are just getting started on apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this as a gift for a special needs child, he was able to use mine with ease so I bought his his own. Best Buy carries amazing covers as well and he is now able to listen to music, learn colors and numbers, and access movies in a fun interactive way. This is an amazing purchase for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good tab for the price not a big issue if you break it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great! I would definately buy again! I use this often.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great value for a tablet. Was a gift for dad in his fifties and it is simple enough for him to use and play word games and watch Netflix and stuff. Got it on sale for $39 which was a steal. I should have gotten another one for that price . Best Buy always has great prices and selections especially when they go on sale. Dad loves his Amazon tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to setup and use. The content is very clear. Connect to wireless or Ethernet and off to the races.\n",
      "Positive :-> Ok so I tried the free trials for hulu, netflix and amazon. This device allows you to acess them all and many others. But don't expect much to be free. After your monthly free trial with amazon you have to pay for the whole year up front which equals to a little less then hulu or netflix monthly fee's. Amazon offers many movies for this deal but I noticed many movies like new releases and a lot of series are not free and the rent prices are higher then red box. This device is also better if you have cable already because you can link it to your regular cable feeds. It is a bit complex and you have to down load all kinds of things. But the device is made as good as an iphone maybe better I was impressed with the hardware and the boot speed, but be prepared to invest in more bandwidth to run this device smoothly. When I watch anything on it I make sure everything else that feeds from the modem is offline.\n",
      "Neutral :-> ok product serves the purpose nothing more than that\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle products are easy to use and set up. It does most everything the expensive tablets do.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for the money and basic media. I enjoy it for reading, audible, and streaming video. Uses Amazon App Store which uses google play. Thousands of apps!\n",
      "Positive :-> I upgraded from the Kindle Touch so I could have a built in light. The light is fantastic. While it took some getting used to the press buttons for page turning on the side, I love that too. Can use it with one hand, and don't have to take hands off to touch the screen. The documentation could use some work. A diagram with what all those icons are that they refer to would be a big help. Took me a long time to figure out how to get the reading progress to what I wanted. One thing, I HATE the new bookmark method. The old 'corner fold' was easier and less intrusive. Still can figure out how to delete from My Clippings. Also I wish Amazon would come out with a case similar to an Otter Box. I don't want leather OR auto turn on, which seems to be problematic on nearly every case I look at.\n",
      "Positive :-> What a great product. Fun, helpful and great sound for a speaker. I highly recommend!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy for my wife to play music she likes by just asking. Works great on Fire Tv. Still hooking up lights and controllers but all has been easy to do.\n",
      "Positive :-> This devise is awesome you can do so much with this adult toy makes life easier at times highly recommend\n",
      "Positive :-> Just right for my mom. Got it and put prime on it for her and Netflix along with some games. I think she likes it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've already read 4 books on this, and while it took a bit to get used to compared to a physical book, the convenience factor makes this a great purchase!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great sound easy to set up and use. My wife is truly enjoying it.\n",
      "Positive :-> An excellent tablet at a low cost. It more than met my expectations for basic use such as video watching and gaming.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire tv is the best box, fast, good interface and simple\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the fire stick and the fire tv. We use the fire tv in our family room where our WIFI connection is weak. Streams beautifully!\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect tablet for the money and quality. I had to buy another as a Christmas gift\n",
      "Positive :-> I had the fire stick and the fire Tv is so much better.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice product.My kids love it,good for YouTube search.\n",
      "Positive :-> Ive had the 1st kindle so it took time to get used to no keyboard but love the built in light that has auto adjusting. The homepage isnt as friendly\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the screen colors and the easy accessible apps and internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product does exactly what I wanted it to do and is good value for the purchase price.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is Affordible and supper useful! If your am Amazon kinda person I definitely recommend this\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect product that met my needs and expectations.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the Amazon echo a little over a month ago. I like the concept of the echo but unfortunately it's not as responsive as I had hoped. Trying to get local news is nearly impossible. It's also not in sync with my Amazon account. Packages I ordered on Amazon that are delivered, it will still tell me are still in route. I think the speaker is a decent quality and I stream music quite often. I probably would not buy it again. Too expensive for the limited things it can do. Again, I like the concept but it still needs a lot of improvements.It's advertised as though it will make your life easier but other than creating a shopping list for me, I have not had an overwhelming life enhancing experience.\n",
      "Positive :-> it works better than the other product that I have\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids love it . I love the size and weight . It not easy to broke or crack\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for an age of streaming tv! Very little maintenance and setup\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been on the fence for quite some time about getting a dedicated e-reader. Like many, I didn't want to spend money and yet another device. However, review after review always mentions that where the value in the Kindle is in the distraction-free reading experience and having finally purchased one, I wholeheartedly agree with this as well. The Kindle Paperwhite is light weight and is easy to carry around. This is my first Kindle since the 2nd gen, and I'm impressed by the speed and screen quality. The lighting on the Paperwhite is a huge benefit and is not at all distracting while reading.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is really easy to program and use. I am looking forward to connecting it to some of the smart items I have In my home.\n",
      "Positive :-> Its nice to have a companion that only talks when spoken to ,Alexa is the only women who doesn't argue lol\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this to get updates on weather and stock market but found many more uses. Many different apps to add during setup. And she tells jokes too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet is easy to use and I can carry it with me in a medium size purse. Easy to down load books and other information. I had the Kindle before and this upgrade is a pleasure!\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves this tablet because of all the apps on the store. we love it because of the parental controls allow us to control what he gets in the app store lol\n",
      "Positive :-> After seeing and playing with the Amazon Echo at my sister's home, I just had to have one. After having it for a bit, I'm looking towards the future and what Alexa will hopefully do next. Already have the Nest thermostat and Hue lighting, but there's more potential. Will wait and see...\n",
      "Positive :-> We purchased this item because our Smart TV has slowed down (Its a few years old) and we were tired of having to use our game consoles and/or phones to stream content. This solved our problem. The Fire TV is very fast and has tons of content.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience.\n",
      "Positive :-> It works well w/ existing prime members for videos. The device can be enabled to utilize amazon free for parents to control contents on the device (games, videos, books, etc). but there is a monthly charge to the service.\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm ambivalent about this tablet. It's a great price point and the picture quality is amazing. It's great for watching Netflix. But, you are locked in to only the apps available on Amazon. I can't download my browser if choice or even the google search app. Additionally, the tablet is linked to Amazon, and basically unusable if you don't have a valid Amazon account, I bought an additional tablet for a non Amazon person and they couldn't download any apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a great investment. Can read at night without disturbing partner. Only disadvantage is if you lose your place it is a little difficult to find it. This could be user problem.\n",
      "Positive :-> Just needs more memory, but we can handle that. My boys love them!\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my husband on Amazon and then got two more for grandkids at Christmas from Best Buy. They had a great Black Friday deal on them.\n",
      "Positive :-> My granddaughter is very happy great for kids to learn , reading help\n",
      "Positive :-> The fire tv is one of the best android boxes out there great for any streaming media you can imagine\n",
      "Positive :-> I had to pick this up, for the deal of the day, when I saw it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second Kindle as I updated from a previous model. This is lighter more comfortable to hold and the internal light is amazing.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for a Christmas for a family member gift even thought I wasn't too sure of the quality of this tablet because it was very inexpensive. The person who received the tablet was very satisfied with the speed, screen resolution and apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice e-reader. A bit smaller and definitely lighter than the Paperwhite. 'Whiter' screen still easy on the eyes. A bit expensive for just a reader however.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the blue tooth remote, does freeze up from time to time\n",
      "Positive :-> My nephew always wanted to play games on my phone, so when I saw this tablet on sale I picked it up thinking it would make him happy to have his own tablet to play games. For past month, I have not seen him once with out it. Big score for favorite Aunt..\n",
      "Positive :-> Thought the Echo was portable. Have to keep it plugged it to operate or buy an external battery.Returned and bought the smaller TAP which has a builtin battery.\n",
      "Positive :-> wanted to bring computer life to big screen. don't have smart tv, so this was perfect\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this to watch Amazon Prime programing and Playstation Vue.This is way faster than the Fire Stick. Although I still have occasional glitches I can't for sure say its from the Fire TV versus the services.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is a lot of fun! I use it every morning to get the news, and to listen to music.\n",
      "Positive :-> very good for the price. our kid loves to play with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I can watch a ton of shows now with this. Well worth the money\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle paperwhite comes with back light so it can be reader without enough light source. Since it uses e-ink, it can be read under bright light. Moreover, it is not costly at all.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazing deal. Good product. I am satisfied........\n",
      "Positive :-> its a good starter device for the kids but it has limitations for what you can download because its not an apple device.\n",
      "Positive :-> It was really easy to set up. A much more inexpensive alternative to cable television.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought my Echo to explore some new technology. When I walk in my house after getting off work I ask Alexa to play some music from my play list and there it goes. Alexa keeps me up to date on the weather, Emails me recipes, plays triva games and so much more.\n",
      "Positive :-> Sweet product by Amazon, as usual. It's legit, most definitely\n",
      "Positive :-> Do not turn cable off. Using with cable service...\n",
      "Positive :-> I was searching for kindle for gifting it to my bro. I got the best deal at bestbuy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up and lets me stream everything I want to\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent priced portable tablet good for carrying around. Very light and small.\n",
      "Positive :-> Combining this with Amazon prime made this an excellent choice for my 1st grader. They have so many free books and learning games.\n",
      "Positive :-> like the individual charger as i do not always have a usb port device with me when i travel\n",
      "Positive :-> INEXPENSIVE GREAT TABLET/E-READER. HIGHLY RECOMMEND\n",
      "Positive :-> Lots of Fun!! Useful for New, Weather and Alarms - Great Speakfor for the size - Easy to Set up\n",
      "Negative :-> Customer service rep took my sale was horrible. Would not recommend her as a customer friendly person\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my tablet!! I didn't think at first that I would like this size but it is perfect for me. I would recommend this tablet to all my friends.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had a couple of firesticks and they just don't work as good as the fire tv's. I now have 2 fire tv's. One is hard wired and one runs on wifi. I don't have any issues with them at all.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent for travel, games, email, small enough to carry\n",
      "Positive :-> The device is great to have in your home...like asking what the weather would be like...playing your favorite sound etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love reading my books on it. It is comfortable to hold for long periods of time. I have prime so the music is great. I carry it with me everywhere\n",
      "Positive :-> Good over all i had competitors sreaming devices and none were as good as this i would recommend to buy\n",
      "Positive :-> I love how user friendly it is. It was a gifts for my daughter who is not very good with technology. She loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> I would have to say this things is so cool. control most of my plug in stuff, like AC in the room turns it on and off with the modular\n",
      "Positive :-> Already purchased fire stick but wanted a box with a little more capability. The android boxes were priced over $200. This box is dual wifi band plus has ethernet. Runs great with no issues. Would recommend\n",
      "Neutral :-> doesnot work After three weeksI cannot open it. so sad\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought a 7' kindle on Black Friday for $34.00. What a great price for a great gift..\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect size ,very useful and my daughter loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is perfect for a parent who wants to monitor what their children are doing. As well as being able to control what their kids can and can not do on the internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it's \"awesome\", which is high praise indeed.\n",
      "Positive :-> I loved the kindle fire so much that I purchased a second one for my husband.\n",
      "Positive :-> Can't beat the price and features on this tablet. All the features are competitive even with Amazon's proprietary operating system and appstore. Most common Google play apps are available, but if they're not, chances are there is something analogous. Navigation can be a little cumbersome as it isn't as customizable as some might like, but bottom line is, it's a pretty full feature tablet for fifty bucks.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great and fun to use. I like the music link up and news\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for the price. Good size. Easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.\n",

      "Positive :-> Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the Echo. Would recommend this to everyone. It is very fun and knowledgeable\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for all round entertainment. I connected it to my Amazon account and even my phone so o could view my pictures on the TV. I unfortunately had to return it because one of the purposes for which I bought it was not fulfiled.\n",
      "Positive :-> Must have all family member's enjoy and can use love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my 8 yr old. They absolutely love it. Clear display and durable\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Echo is truly awesome. Better than Google Home in my experience. It's just an awesome device to have around the house. Highly recommend, 10/10!\n",
      "Positive :-> Fire box is great. Easy start up and also to navigate thru for beginers in the streaming tv world.\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo will quickly become your best friend. Her sound is clear and crisp. Music is fabulous. She takes notes, make lists, read to you, make jokes and the list goes on!\n",
      "Neutral :-> Bought it when it was 50 percent off. Good product.\n",
      "Positive :-> This an amazing speaker. Absolutely great sound! The capabilities are endless. I would recommend this product to everyone. Very pleased!\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great for my 6 year old grandson! he loves it.\n",
      "Negative :-> Not happy that the product had no instruction book to go with it to help set it up. Not a big fan of the online tutorial. Had a really hard time in powering it off. Camera setting did not take very good pictures. DID NOT LIKE THE MULTIPLE ADS ON IT EVERY TIME I USED IT. FINALLY IT LOCKED UP ON ME AND I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING IT TO GO TO SETTINGS SO I COULD DO ANYTHING WITH IT. Probably will be returning this product to Best Buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not a bad product and for the price it makes a decent gift.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my kindle so much. It has a great screen clarity. Also the price was on point.\n",
      "Positive :-> Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very user friendly product. 100 times better than Siri. Play music from Prime music. If you have a Amazon Prime account, I would recommend you to try this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had some issues with this but not having a very helpful team to resolve issues.... I work and go to school I don't have time after time to beg and plead to get fixed...\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect, just needs an app to locate when set aside\n",
      "Positive :-> I started with a basic kindle four years ago After two years I purchased the kindle Fire HDX. I have been very satisfied with it. Now I also have the new kindle fire. So when one is charging I can use the other device\n",
      "Positive :-> Unlike the larger version, this does not need to be plugged in..making it portable....although you have to press the button for every request..it's great to take with you where ever you go..fully rechargable\n",
      "Positive :-> My 10yr old loves it . He stays on the pad for hours and never get bored ....\n",
      "Positive :-> I had the Fire Stick, but upgraded to the Fire TV so run Kodi. Works great\n",
      "Positive :-> The night reading is perfect. This is a big improvement from the previous model.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a very neat product. Can be frustrating at times when trying to control smart home devices. Have patience when learning new devices.\n",

      "Positive :-> It was just what I was looking for. So far I have had no issues with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's great for doing anything on Amazon. However you cannot use Google cards to purchase anything with. They're great for reading books surfing the net games, are abundance and the processor is fast so you really don't have a lag\n",
      "Positive :-> Who needs a laptop that takes up so much space? Go for this Amaon Fire that fits in your hands. It has capabilities for multiple accounts and time limits for children...or even your spouse. Worth the price and very convenient. No lap required.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is a machine that does what it says. The Speaker is similar to my $250 bluetooth speaker. The commands are easy and I find myself using Alexa many times a day. Much better responsiveness than Siri on my phone.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 2 girls ages 2 and 5 absolutely love these tablets.\n",
      "Positive :-> I wanted a low cost but quality tablet and this one is a dream! Easy to navigate and excellent graphics.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought 2 of these so far and they work great for the price. Buy a mini SD card with it because it only has 8GB onboard. This tablet is a good buy for your kids and you can enable parental controls if you choose to do so. I would recommend this tablet as a good buy. It's not the fastest thing around but it gets the job done. At 50 dollars you can break it and not care lol.\n",
      "Positive :-> Just what my grandson wanted. Perfect price, can't wait until he opens it\n",
      "Positive :-> Pretty comparable to the other streaming devices I own other than the obvious Amazon geared menu.\n",

      "Positive :-> This is small and lightweight which makes it great for road trips.Easy to read.\n",

      "Negative :-> I will not recommend this one, do slow and I ended up returning this product\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this as a gift for my aunt, after Her laptop went out.She is happy with the ability to download apps and play games while in her recliner and even found apps for texting. It's very good for people who are not so well versed with technology and don't require a lot of storage space. She loves it, which is all that matters!\n",
      "Positive :-> An Apple TV was out of the question - lacked access to Prime videos and forced me to rent from iTunes (rarely offers discounted rentals). Leaving me with Roku or the Fire TV. Went with the Fire TV to try something different (owned Rokus before), and have been very pleased. The UI looks great, the voice search is reliable and ability to access so many apps easily makes it easy for others to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have owned all the past generations of fire stick and this blows them out of the water.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it I bought once for my son and a year later in still good conditions someone stole it sad day but he's birthday was coming so I went ahead and got him a new one he's in love with it.\n",

      "Positive :-> Once up and running, Alexa can perform a variety of your typical assistant features. Itll set timers, tell you the time, set alarms, tell you what your day looks like from your connected calendar, tell you about your commute or the weather and answer questions about all sorts of things\n",
      "Positive :-> My dad is a first time user for anything techie he has really enjoyed it.\n",
      "Positive :-> got this a gift for a friend, she loved it and the things she can do with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for the price! Will definitely buy again\n",
      "Positive :-> Not only does what Siri does, but it takes it one step further by completing tasks that you ask it to do, like ordering pizza or ubers, which I do plenty of. With extra devices hooked to lights in your home, for example, you can ask Echo to turn your lights on, dim them, etc., before entering the home. This can be a real safety feature.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Kindle Fire is lighter than my old one. The speed is great & all apps load very quickly. I also like that it comes in different colors.\n",
      "Positive :-> We have it set up in the kitchen. Mainly use it to play music and give us the weather forecast. She really is amaxing at answering general questions\n",
      "Positive :-> My 6 year old got it for Christmas and is able to use it very well\n",
      "Positive :-> This is our 2nd Echo. My husband had to have his own for his use outside by the pool so when he wanted to find out something, he could just ask Alexa and find the answer all while laying in the pool and watching tv. Such a fun thing to have around and ask questions to.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Fire TV to watch Playstation Vue. It has a good app for that. I like the setup and the ability to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime videos.\n",
      "Positive :-> I originally bought this because of frustration in using my IPad for several websites. So I decided to try the Fire tablet. Well it did get me to the websites that IOS on my IPad didn't. But I started to investigate it more thoroughly. I checked the manual and started to have more fun. The camera works great , and the apps are great! This was to be a secondary purchase but I am using it more and more.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like it because you can hardwire it. works a whole lot faster then the stick.\n",
      "Positive :-> While I have used an ipad in the past, this is hands down a huge improvement in the ability to read books. The backlighting and type font are great and it is extremely easy to download books.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is easy to set up and navigate. Great for catching up on missed tv shows.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nothing but the best way to read books. Love the way it looks and the fact that I can read anywhere!\n",
      "Positive :-> this is the best tablet out there.....great bang for your buck\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is a cool speaker and has some neat tricks if you're vested in the Amazon universe. I am not. It's still neat as a bluetooth speaker, but if it weren't on sale, I would not find as much utility for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle Fire is a great value doing most of what more expensive tablets do for a great price.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this Amazon fire thing so much, I said bye bye to direct tv.. This will also save me over $100 a month. That's just icing on the cake for me!!!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought Alexa for my father in law for Christmas in which he loved!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for our daughter and she loves it. Great for reading, playing games, and research.\n",
      "Positive :-> The screen is sharp and response is good. Set up is easy\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought it for my daughter. she seems to be entertained.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet one for my daughter and one for my nephew. They seem to enjoy it a lot.\n",
      "Positive :-> This device is the coolest thing in my house. I speak, It listens. Who could ask for anything better. Joking aside it will spoil you when it comes to day to day events and searches.\n",
      "Positive :-> My child loved it!!! She was able to play her games!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love Amazon Fire tv. It works well because it offers the Fox News and my shows I like on PS Vue\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is like the iPhone when it first came out. It is something you don't know you want/need until you get it and then you realize you can't live without it! Alexa is quite good at voice recognition and once you get it set up, you can: play music on demand, get weather, news and traffic info, order items on Amazon, control connected devices and much more. I am an Amazon Prime member and opted in to the Amazon Music service. What a treat to ask Alexa to play a specific song or only a certain type of music on demand. So much more I am still discovering. \"Alexa - Connect to Bluetooth\" is also great. The Echo is great sounding on it's own as well. Buy them on Sale and give them as gifts!\n",
      "Positive :-> great tablet! pros: good size (especially for travelling) android based so 3rd party apps can be installedcons: amazon ads will appear instead of a wallpaper on the lock screen, apparently you can pay to get rid of them which is just ridiculous can be slow when playing certain gamesnot a lot of storage space\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle paper white is great. Easy to read with. Lightweight so you can throw it in your purse or travel bag & take it anywhere. I haven't had the chance to use it outside yet, but will when the weather warms up. Best gift I ever gave myself!\n",
      "Positive :-> Have enjoyed it since we set it up the first night. Kids love to ask random questions every morning and the jokes are actually funny.\n",
      "Positive :-> It works wonderfully. Works faster than the first generation.\n",
      "Positive :-> great purchase. it does everything as expected. very easy to setup.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazing device. I have found so much that can be done without picking up my phone. Love it. You you will be happy you purchased it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best tablet I've ever owned. Super clear picture, amazing sound & the battery lasts forever. Brightness is adjustable so it's great for reading or games & playing around on the internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Ran out to buy a tablet quickly and was pleasantly surprised by this one! Great price easy purchase!\n",
      "Positive :-> Exceeded my expectation. Easy to read, books load and store with ease ! Great for saving space for avid reader. I can travel with many books dont have to worry about space\n",
      "Positive :-> Runs awesome for a good amount of time. Unfortunately sometimes the device disconnects or asks to be refreshed, during that time the remote does not work and it is frozen on that screen. Other than that it runs very fast and is a great unit. The fix for that is unplugging and replugging.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is very functional and user friendly! Great for kids too!\n",
      "Positive :-> If you like the Amazon Echo and want it to be portable, this is the solution. The stereo speaker sounds good for how small it is. The built in Alexa functionality makes it a better choice than other similar sized (and priced) portable speakers.\n",
      "Positive :-> For the money the best tablet you can buy. I bought a bunch of these for my nieces to play with. I love my kindle and for the money it allows them to do a wide variety of activities.\n",
      "Positive :-> I would recommend this product to anyone that loves reading e-books.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 3 of these for my children for christmas and they love them! Great tablet for game apps they have had a blast playing theirs! So far we haven't had any technical issues such as lagging etc. I would highly recommend this to a mom of kids that love to play games this is a perfect purchase for you!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's definitely not a top of the line tablet but great for the price the kids love it\n",
      "Positive :-> Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster.\n",
      "Positive :-> MY children love their new Amazon Fire Tablet. Quality picture and sound.\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet was cheap and a great deal. The kids love it. It is very nice because it has a kids mode and a separate parent mode.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablets I bought two of these for a 5 yr and 6 yr the parental control is an awesome feature. No regrets whatsoever.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two of these tablets for my twin boys bday! They just turned 8 years old on Aug 22. They really like them. Also the graphics are awesome. I really would like to get the purple for myself.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I'm really happy!\n",
      "Positive :-> My first kindle has been to about 20 different countries. I just loaded up with some great books and take off on a vacation. I used to load up with actual books and leave them behind as I finished them. I'm on my second Kindle and it's just so convenient to read in bed and easy to turn the pages. It also fits easily into my purse next to my cell phone so I can read any time I have a few minutes.\n",
      "Positive :-> Makes book downloading and reading easy as ever. So compact and lightweight too.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for my mom 4 days before Christmas with 2 day free shipping. It arrived on time with no issues. My mom loves it! She likes to read digital books and watch Netflix and this tablet allows her to do both. She also loves that it's small enough to fit in her purse and Bluetooth capable.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for someone as a gift and they enjoy it, asking for the weather while doing other things around the house or having your favorite music play. I've tested it and am amazed and what it can do, look forward to what it will be capable of in the future.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my husband primarily so he could get the Wall Street Journal. It works great and he loves that it holds a charge, nice size, durable, great resolution, etc. it turned out to be a great gift!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my daughter. Tablet works amazing. Only thing I didnt like was that you are REQUIRED to place a CC on file with amazon in order to use it.I would say if you are looking for a tablet stick to the samsung galaxy models vs others.\n",
      "Positive :-> awesome tablet , great price, everything i wa hoping it would be\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for reading in all conditions with great battery life\n",
      "Positive :-> It kind of small yes, but very practical if you do not want to buy I pad mini\n",
      "Positive :-> This Amazon TV was very easy to set up. I really enjoy all the features that it has to offer. I find myself not watching cable TV as much because now I can pick and choose the type of programs I prefer to watch. The problem with cable TV other than the outrages high prices is that you are paying for channels that you never watch.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this Tablet for my 3 years old granddaughter and she really loves it. Very easy to use !\n",
      "Positive :-> biased in favor of right handed persons but performs as promised. it would be nice if a lefty could move pages with his left hand as a righty can move pages with his right hand.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Kindle paperwhite. The backlit screen is great for reading at night, it has a long battery life and I love being able to use it in full sunlight.\n",
      "Positive :-> I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product, my customer really enjoyed receiving it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best then Siri. This is my 3rd purchase. Got a dot and a tap as well. And they all working inside the same house in different rooms.\n",
      "Positive :-> I totally love the Kindle Fire tablets purchased for my grandkids. My sister purchased one in our hometown for my mother. She is equally happy. My granddaughter and grandson spend their wind down time in the evening on the tablets playing their favorite games. In addition, they want a dog and conduct research for the type of dog that the would like. Overall, the tablets are easy to use and provides technology for them when they visit every other weekend. I am pleased.\n",
      "Positive :-> Everyone should have one of these in their home. My kids use it to assist with homework from spelling to math. I use it to get daily updates on news, traffic and weather. With this product, the future is now!\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for kids and adults sometimes it takes a little time to pull up old movies but shows great.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like this tablet for the price I paid it is easy to use, setup, and I like the way it looks.\n",
      "Positive :-> Exactly what I thought the amazon fire stick would be.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this ..the sound is so good i like it better than the small one and Alexa can hear me even im far. It was an amazing product and i got good deal of course fr Best Buy!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. No issues. I recommend it for all users\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it , great hd movies and to install programs to watch online.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great the service was great and I really like it.!\n",
      "Positive :-> I really love the back light on the paperwhite. I upgraded from an old kindle keyboard with a lighted case - and I love having the backlight built in. I considered the Voyage, to get the page press feature, but am very happy with the touch screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm not very good with electronics, so I was worried about learning how to use my Kindle Fire. I had no problems at all with navigation of this device. I feel it's also fast I was expecting it to be sluggish. I think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain.\n",
      "Positive :-> Have not used the product. This item was a gift and I have not yet received word on the product.\n",
      "Positive :-> We love these entry level tablets. We have bought at least ten of them for various family and friends.\n",
      "Positive :-> i like the way that it is small and easy to carry and doesnt take up alot of power\n",
      "Positive :-> It works for just what I need it to. Reading. I also love how the camera works & the games.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Not what I expected .. This thing pretty much runs according to skills & not just ask a question & it searches the Internet. I find Siri much better because it does search the net. I can ask the same question the same way & you always get an answer with Siri but not with Alexia. It always say I do not understand the question. Again this thing needs much improvement & it's not worth the price tag especially when Siri is included with my iPhone.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my dad, he is 87. Very easy to use and setup. He loves it and uses it 3/4 hours a day\n",
      "Positive :-> So happy I went with the Kindle Paperwhite. LOVE it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Wound up finding one at Best Buy when no one else had any. I absolutely have found my new favorite gadget in the Echo and have found so many fun things it can do to help organize my life.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was happy with the Echo but because I'm all Google I returned and went with the Google home. As far as the Echo the speaker was really good, picked up my voice from everywhere around my apartment (google home doesn't do as good as Alexa) Its a great toy for anyone\n",
      "Positive :-> Works beautifully and I enjoy the product. My daughter loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love being able to add items to my grocery list or listen to a particular song whenever I want.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my nephew since he dropped his last one in the toilet and we didn't purchase the accidental coverage last time. He is only 8 but loves to play games on it. Since it's linked to my amazon account I can see what games he is downloading and control the purchases made. Definitely a must have for long car rides!\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm so far loving this e-reader. Haven't used it outside yet, but the lighting seems really good. I'm taking it on vacation next week, it will be my lifesaver for long flights and waits. (I only wish it had a headphone jack and audio option)\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my Father but added a 32GB drive so he can have more storage. Love the idea that you can do that & wish Apple would do the same.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this as a gift, but have owned three myself. Hands down the best reading experience. I LOVE my Kindle!That said, this version of their software lost some functions in terms of listing and collections that I really miss. Improvements always have a price, I guess.\n",
      "Positive :-> Its a good product . Speed , price and apps are apt\n",
      "Positive :-> Not much to say except that it does exactly what it's supposed to do.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like it. it's better to read books online even I owned iPhone, iPad,and itc.\n",
      "Positive :-> I would recommend this product to all my friends and family!\n",
      "Positive :-> Not a bad tablet, BUT not an amazing tablet. It costs 50 dollars for a reason. It is a basic tablet, kind of like having a bigger iPhone 3, if you get the reference.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for a birthday gift. They loved it. We found ourselves playing with it for hours.... Alexa what is???\n",
      "Positive :-> IT IS A VERT GOOD ITEM\n",
      "Positive :-> Best value tablet for the little ones. Great warranty, great parental controls. It's a shame Apple hasn't caught on to the needs of parents when it comes to digital media.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have two Echos in my home, I use it mostly for listening to my Spotify playlists and ordering stuff online off Amazon. I also love the ease of creating shopping lists and the fact that new abilities are added everyday. I just wish it was a lot more intuitive, I want Alexa to learn tricks on its own and not have to teach it tricks. I would give the Echo 4 stars for current functionality which is limited and 5 stars for future potential. Must have.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been a book fan and was surprised how much I love this.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price for an introductory tablet. Bought for my brother in law who is not tech savvy. He has loved it. Easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am shocked at the super low price for a very functional and handy tablet. Easily the best tablet on the market under $50!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good tablet for the price it does everything that i need to do except take pictures but that's not what i bought it for\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for 40 bucks my daughter loves it .finally I get my phone back\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well with Alexa controlled switches and external systems. Needs work on answering arbitrary questions that need to be looked up online. but over all worth the price of admission.\n",
      "Positive :-> Cute little fire. It seems to be worth the value for all the things it can do. It could run a little faster. Nice for the buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the back light and has lots of memory. Very compact...easy to carry.\n",
      "Positive :-> Well worth the investment. Picture quality is on par with Verizon FiOS. Purchased 2 units. One used wirelessly the other via LAN connection. Without a loop, picture quality very similar. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Positive :-> My niece loves this tablet & I love the Amazon add on that lets me control what she can do, how long she has per day, and when it turns off for the night/ turns on in the morning.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have the first generation Kindle Paperwhite and my fiance has the latest and greatest. The screen clarity and response time is greatly improved and it's still being offered at the same price. If you're a bookworm who either reads before bed and/or travels a lot, a Kindle makes a lot of sense. I like that you can dial in the screen brightness so that you can still fall asleep after reading. The battery life is great, too!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased as a gift and person that received was happy and excited!\n",
      "Positive :-> Simple to use. Great for Dad who wants to play games and check weather\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this speaker it works wonderfully. Very recommend\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an easy to use box. Voice control is a nice bonus!\n",
      "Positive :-> I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few \"I didn't understand that\" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a very good starter tablet. We have purchased several others that did not perform as well. The no-name brands do not have the clear display that this one does.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really like it because i can watch a lot of movies\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this just to have as a device to read my comixology account. Works perfectly for my needs!!\n",
      "Positive :-> ALEXA IS GOOD FOR REMINDERS, USE AS AN ALARM CLOCK, PLAY MUSIC NICE SPEAKER SYSTEM ALSO WORKS WITH WEMO AND OTHER SYSTEMS THAT CONTROL YOUR ELECTRONICS IN THE HOUSE INCLUDING HEATING AND COOLING.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am very happy about this Amazon tablet purchase at Best Buy and it is working great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works flawlessly. Interface is much faster than the stick.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Fire for my 8 year old for school after a suggestion from the sales rep in store. Went to set it up and it required a credit card number be entered. Couldn't even download free kids apps. Why would I want my child able to accidently buy something? I refused and thus not able to download anything. We will be returning it. Product appears best for an adult who likes to read books on tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Go for it what ever spending on this more than worth of it\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for a friend she loved it! She always wanted a kindle for reading coz she is an \"electronic worm\". I am glad she loved it\n",
      "Positive :-> great starter tablet for any 2nd grader on up great price\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is has many features and small so you carry it around and light in weight.\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet has good response time and multi tasking is seamless as well! Good vivid colors!\n",
      "Positive :-> This was the best purchase I've made in a while. The text quality it excellent and the back-lighting is a real plus.\n",
      "Positive :-> I wanted a tablet for my son to play games and read books. I didn't want to spend hundreds because he is only 8. This is perfect, I can put controls on what he views and password protect my control profile.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my Fire TV. Very user friendly and I love the remote.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fire tv tablet has great apps and are easy to function\n",
      "Positive :-> This is just a basic kindle fire for my 7 yr old child. It works fine for her. It obviously doesn't have comparable picture quality when compared to the HDX versions, but it still has the same functions. It does have a rear and forward facing camera, making it easy to take pictures of the dog. There are lots of safety features and apps for kids also.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a gift for someone but I haven't heard of any issues\n",
      "Positive :-> much better than the stick...do not i repeat do not waste your time or money on the stick...go directly to the fire tv\n",
      "Positive :-> This is used daily in my house. I would highly recommend this product and buy it for a gift for a friend.\n",
      "Positive :-> Cute speaker. a bit expensive but the amazon streaming capabilities make it worth it\n",
      "Positive :-> Gift was on point. Recipient was very pleased. Would recommend to others.\n",
      "Positive :-> Meets the needs. very well designed and a good place to start for reading ebooks and watching online shows on the go.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've owned a Kindle Fire HD7 before and this newer Kindle fire didn't disappoint. It does the job really well for most things and the price you pay, but don't expect it to be a top of the line tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was impressed how clear the words on the screen are!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have purchased a few of these items they are perfect for getting rid of tv\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is awesome. You can play your favorite music instantly. Also had great fun asking Alexa questions. Some serious some funny. We love it!!\n",
      "Positive :-> This kindle is perfect to have nearby at all times. It's simplicity keeps the reader engaged in just the reading material, without any other distractions. The lighting is perfect- does not irritate my eyes.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had it with high cable bills and was looking for an inexpensive alternative. Several of my friends told me about the Amazon Firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable TV bills. I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it’s not cable. I miss cable, but I don’t miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment. Although you have to keep an eye on the premium channels offering free 7 day trials and remember to put a security code on your remote in order to avoid guests, kids, and other persons from ordering a bunch of the pay channels provided on Amazon Firebox. Other than that, I am one happy customer.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well, except during internet outages. The ability to perform hands-free tasks in the kitchen is priceless.\n",
      "Positive :-> We are very happy with our new Alexa product. We are so happy that we have been calling our daughter daily with new ideas on how to use it. This has prompted her purchase one as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Prefer no amps on unit and just allow buyer to place the amps they want or will ever use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa works great. Very easy to use and speaker sounds awesome.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had the Apple TV, Cromecast, and Amazon Fire and Amazon has the most options that fit what I watch and use not to mention it has the best HD quality I highly recommend it\n",
      "Positive :-> Almost like reading a real book. Don't is crisp, sharp and easy to read. I've held out from buying a reader for years because I could never quite get past the fact it wasn't a book. With this new kindle I don't even notice, I am immediately immersed. Wildly better than I expected.\n",
      "Positive :-> Does exactly what it is supposed to do\n",
      "Positive :-> great tablet for the price. excellent gift for anyone\n",
      "Positive :-> I am a Flight Attendant and I love this small sleek book!!!! It is a must have. The only thing I would change is, I would add audio\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Kindle Paperwhite! It's very easy to use and lightweight. The best part is that I can read it outside during the day or late at night in bed. It's easier on my eyes than reading from the Kindle ap on my phone.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was the perfect choice for travelling. It's very light and very clear, easy to read screen\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a gift for my wife. She uses it mostly in place of her old black & white Kindle...mama is happy...so I am happy...\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo has surprised me in many ways. While the features are nothing new, the ability to access them through pure voice control has been incredible.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 2 of these for my niece & nephew! They think I'm awesome now!!! I'd say they were definitely worth the purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my kindle fire. It is a 16 GB but I change it to 32GB.\n",
      "Positive :-> I ordered the Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Adapter for Fire Tablets and Kindle eReaders however, what I received is nothing like what is pictured. I received a charger cord that states LG Electronics and Verizon Accessory. I am not certain that these are the same item.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loves it! She uses it with ease, which makes me an mommy very happy. No complaints. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. Very helpful employees at Best Buy as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this charger...charges my devices super fast and I don't have to wait hours\n",
      "Positive :-> Best tablet you can get in the price range. Very dependable and hasn't had any issues. Got it for my mom for reading books and doing some internet browsing. Was very easy for her to learn and my kids use it when they are at her house too. Would recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased after theft in Seattle. It was on sale and works great.\n",
      "Positive :-> I brought a bargain tablet about a year ago and ended up very disappointed in the browsing speed. I basically wanted a tablet for quick web searches without having to boot my PC. I was nervous to try again, but am SO glad I did. The Amazon Fire $50 tablet is AWESOME for quick surfing tasks. I also use the Kindle e-reader app on it, and this works well too. The reason for my 4-star rating (instead of 5) is two-fold, but both are related to apps. My first issue is the Yahoo email app - for some reason I don't have access to my contacts in it! I didn't realize this at first when I was just reading emails, but trying to send an email was awful... it took about a half hour because I had to dig through my inbox for emails from the people I wanted to send to so I could find their address to put in the TO box of the new message I was creating. What a pain! The other issue is that the app world is dominated by \"for iPhone\" and \"for Android\", so you may be severely limited in what you can find for this tablet because it doesn't fit neatly into one of those two categories. However these are minor annoyances and not the primary reason why I wanted a tablet. So if you need to do quick Internet searches/research or want to use the eReader, then you cannot beat this price for the quality you receive. Love, love, love my new Amazon Fire tablet!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> But, this isn't a bad substitute. The print and light are easily adjustable. It's small and lightweight, easy to carry and holds a charge for a week or so. At the font size I use it takes 2 to 3 kindle page turns to equal 1 page turn of a book and thus I think I would prefer a larger screen. Although it's touted as better for the eyes than reading using the kindle app on a tablet, I really don't think that is the case for me. For me a tablet is just as usable although heavier and less convenient. Overall , for the price, the pros outweigh the cons and I would recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best tablet that has ever come on the market for $49!\n",
      "Positive :-> I was tired of my cable bill being so high so I got the amazon Fire TV + Digital antenna. This is a great alternative to Cable TV.\n",
      "Positive :-> Gave this to my 6 year old. Not a big fan of the Amazon app for purchasing and downloading apps, but other then that he has no problems with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my Echo. Set up was simple and the range of music and information available is fantastic. I would highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids love Alexa & the continued responses. Alexa responds well to anyone's voice in our family. There is so much potential to what Alexa can do, but unfortunately, not something we can continue to put extra money into purchasing all the possible extras right now. We'll just have to add a little here & there.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is a fun gadget. It would be nice if you could give it any name you want but other than that it is a lot of fun.\n",
      "Positive :-> We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn't the best but definitely usable.\n",
      "Positive :-> We are loving this for our son! Fast and comes with all apps he loves!\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is handy and it sounds great when playing music.\n"

      "Positive :-> Grandkids loved the tablets and they seem very durable and long-lasting\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter had her 8\" Kindle Fire HD stolen earlier this year so when we saw this one on sell over the Thanksgiving holiday it was a no brainier to purchase it since it was $100 cheaper than the Fire we purchased a year ago, granted the Fire HD has a much crispier screen but for my 9 year old daughter, she is now happy just to have a tablet again. And it can do all the things she needs it to do: read books, play games, skype, etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very smooth operating system and easy to use for Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids love itBeats buying a galaxy tab that's double the price and compariable in my opinion.\n",
      "Positive :-> It was so slow and problematic i couldnt even get in to the store. Switched to a Samsung and we love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn't like it. It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It's expensive, and that's the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough.\n",
      "Positive :-> Ordering process was easy and as expected. Hopefully my husband will install it soon.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice to listen to music and tv anywere in my home.\n",
      "Positive :-> It even does simple math problems. Who needs a calculator when you have Alexa.\n",
      "Positive :-> For the functionality and price it can't be beat. Why pay more for a sub par off band tablet when you can get a trusted brand. Makes a great gift especially for little ones and you don't break the bank.\n",
      "Positive :-> For those that have Prime this is almost a must have. Keeps all your Amazon stuff in one place.\n",
      "Positive :-> Much better resolution than previous version and easier to use!\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Echo is a lot of fun to have. I use it for streaming music from Amazon and also as a Bluetooth speaker with my phone. Set up took about two minutes- very easy.. Getting it to play music is a lot easier and quicker than scrolling through my stored albums/artist. I'm going to try the 30 trial for Amazon's new music service. I expected it to have an even fuller range of music available. Also, my wife likes Alexa's jokes.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Paperwhite itself is a very nice design and the size makes it portable and easy to hold. The fact that you will be purchasing books from Amazon makes it all the better. Many, many discounted books for 99 cents to 5 dollars. Well worth the price of the reader. Was just on the beach in direct sunlight and no problems whatsoever.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not sure what I can add that thousands of others have not, but the Echo is an awesome device. New features added every week. A must own for anyone interested in the Smart Home movement.\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love the Echo. I use it as part of my smart home set up and Alexa keeps me up to date with my appointments, weather and even traffic when I am about to leave for work. Glad I made this purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a very nice tablet. Still learning how to use it. Always something new to learn on this tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> Use this to stream Netflix, hulu, sling TV, and now Vue tv. Ended up canceling sling TV bc Vue tv is better and more channels for less.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire Tablets for my god-children for Christmas and they love them. The tablets go where ever they go! They play games on them, as well as play educational games to learn different skills needed for school.I love that Amazon made the Fire tablet kids proof and the screen isn't so fragile.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Tap is the first step into making your home a smart home. It will act as a brain to everything else. Unfortunately, you'll have to invest quite a bit more for smart lights, thermostat, locks, etc. to get the full potential out of it. Alone, it merely acts as a Bluetooth speaker and extension of your phone.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this as a gift after using this at another home. I have also tried similar products and I feel that this has the most interactive user interface. It continually is learning and has good sound quality for what we use it for.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon fire connected with Overdrive,Kindle and Amazon aidiobooks.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two of these for my two grandchildren, ages 8 and 10. They love them. They are able to read books and play games on them. They were a great Christmas gift. So much so, that I bought a third one for my son-in-law and he is thrilled with it. The small price made it great for gift giving.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased three of these. One as an upgrade to my old Kindle and two for Xmas gifts. The battery life seems short, but otherwise I have no issues. I used it primarily for reading on the train and browsing the internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> it's a great product to stream all your favorites.\n",
      "Positive :-> It does everything that it is suppose to. It does seam to be a little slow over wifi. Does seam to buffer now and then.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this kindle before travelingin Asia for 6 weeks. I didn't want to bring any expensive electronics I case anything happened. This tablet did everything I hoped and more. It was perfect for reading and keeping in touch with people back home.\n",
      "Positive :-> My eyes feel good with paperwhite when lights out.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased as a gift and my family really enjoyed it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my wife for mothers day, as she wanted something to read in the sunshine this summer, and it performs amazingly in that respect. We have iPads and regular Kindle Fire units (the kids), but only this one can be read in any light, any time of day. Only 4 stars as I'm not sure why terribly more expensive than the Fire units, but it solves for those who like to read under sunlight at the beach or by the pool, couldn't be clearer.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best box for all Apps. Has lots of options! Very fast\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this as a gift for my bookworm wife and she loves it. Typically she likes physical copies but the kindle is a space saver\n",
      "Positive :-> Great 1st tablet for my little nephew downloaded great games and after he dropped it twice still works and looks amazing lol\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is not just for reading books. It works just like a tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> love my kindle the store was clean and well laid out.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well and easily portable. Worth the money...\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my new Fire tablet. Nice backlight helps me to read my E-book in bed. Background color can be changed. I especially like the black background with white lettering; less glare on my eyes while reading.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love being able to listen to radio stations or music\n",
      "Positive :-> good sound quality and understand what you are asking without repeating yourself\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for my child because he previously had one. Not much storage and the cord strips easily.\n",
      "Positive :-> little hard to set up needed help to set up by son\n",
      "Positive :-> This was exactly what we needed. No if it could only make me a sandwich.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is a great tool. It's fun to use, but the DOT has just as much functionality and seems to hear my voice better. The speaker on the Echo is better, but when the volume us up high, it can't hear me at all. The DOT can connect to an external speaker via bluetooth or 3.5mm, and it's a third of the price\n",
      "Positive :-> had the fire hd 7inch reader.. love the new tablet can do so much more and great value for a tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet worked great for keeping in touch in with my wife's mother up north. Very easy to operate.\n",
      "Positive :-> Received item on time. It works great!!! Love the Fire TV!!! I think it works better than the stick, as far as connection and speed are concerned.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a nice reader that we gave to our granddaughter. She enjoys he children’s books she can read and we enjoy the limited Wi-Fi capabilities.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome tablet. Purchased for kids. They love it..\n",
      "Positive :-> I had no idea how great of a purchase this would be for my family period I am the father of 4 girls and this device is used more than any other device in our home. Because of it our home is filled with more music laughter singing and dancing than ever before.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this tablet for my cousin and she loved it.. My kids already had one so i knew she love it.. they are great for kids all ages my youngest got hers when she was 4 and she is 7 now and its still going lol.. she has dropped it and everything they are great tablets I have nothing bad to say about them..\n",
      "Positive :-> You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. The apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. This was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip.\n",
      "Positive :-> The echo is great for someone who doesn't have time to stop every time you need information. Are in the mood for a certain type of music, etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am still learning how to using it. I use it for Facebook, e-mails,play games on Facebook, eventually I want to be able to use the camera which I haven' t figured out yet. Once do I will be doing a lot of picture taking!\n",
      "Positive :-> I can pretty much use voice activation on many things in my house some twiking is needed but I like it ...\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy setup...bought this for 2 grandchildren under 5...they love it\n",
      "Positive :-> The only thing that could have been better than this great great deal would have been the tablet being free. What a great tablet at an amazing price. I'll buy another at its regular price I like it so much.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this Fire HD 7 for my son - he loves it!! I would certainly recommend it to friends and family.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought the kindle fire for my kids for Christmas . So far no issues, they seem to love it.\n",
      "Negative :-> The Kindle Paper white is excellent for reading; however: 1. Product needs to be able to shut OFF! Very unhappy about this. Advertising says will hold charge for weeks - not so, when Kindle paperwhite cannot be shut down. It only holds a charge for a few days, if you read for a couple of hours each day. 2. I have books that I do not intend to read often and want them left in the cloud. I am finding it very close to impossible to return any of my books to the cloud - IT SHOULD BE EASIER!! Amazon made it easy to change Kindle's when I purchased a new one. All Kindle's should be user friendly. Sadly, this is not the case, with the Paperwhite.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon echo is a great product. The only thing is that it doesn't work properly when the tv volume is a little high!\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is excellent. Hard to imagine all these features can be in this unit for under $50.00...It is a must buy, especially if you have children who like to use your tablet. Perhaps buy them one of their own....For us it is one of a few tablets we own, but it is one we are glad to have.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Products are easy to use and navigate thru.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am really glad i decided to purchase the firebox. Faster than the stick.\n",
      "Positive :-> Given me many hours of pleasure. Really enjoy the jigsaw puzzles.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had this tablet for nearly a month now and so far I love it. Is small for portability, it does what I want it and need it to do. I use it to watch movies/series/shows etc from online apps like amazon prime. The price is unbeatable for this tablet. I am def getting my $ worth out of it. Love it would recommend. Makes for a great gift. the camera isnt all that great but I dont use it to take pics at all.\n",
      "Positive :-> It works pretty goodwork properly with the right Internet speed\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought on Black Friday for at a decent discount. Would be a really nice product if I were an Amazon Prome member.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a perfect product for people who use amazon's services.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend.\n",
      "Neutral :-> For $50 this is a fine tablet, However I bought a 64gb SD card to expand the storage, however i have found that a majority of apps are not able to be saved to the external card , nor can they save data to it (for example Netflix). So be warned that you will run out of space and consider the one with the larger internal storage.\n",
      "Positive :-> Loving my Echo. I mostly listen to music. And ask random facts but it was definitely a plus for me.\n",
      "Positive :-> Always loved the Amazon Echo. Now we can rake it with us, outside, wherever!\n",
      "Positive :-> My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7\" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for reading in bright sunlight or night settings. Must for avid readers.\n",
      "Positive :-> The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that.\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the free time application you can set it to, but don't care for the ads that always come up.\n",
      "Positive :-> Salesperson did a good job recommending this item after we explained what we would use it for.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got the Kindle Paperwhite to read on the beach. The screen is easily read in the sun. The compact size is nice for travel too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very comfortable to read from - doesn't give off a bright light if reading at light. Doesn't strain eyes\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is always there when I need her. Plays music, tells jokes, knows how to multiply, add, subtract, keeps a shopping list and a myriad of other things. Really fun!\n",
      "Positive :-> We gave this tablet to our nine year old Grandaughter for her birthday. She loves it and we feel it is very sturdy. That is a very good thing when it comes to tablets and children.\n",
      "Positive :-> This charger is produced by Amazon and backed by its excellent quality control and manufacturing process.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works very well.fast and great if you have a prime account.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my first Kindle and I LOVE It! I considered buying a cheap used one but I'm so glad I went with the Paperwhite! I read in the dark way more than I thought I did. Battery life is amazing!\n",
      "Positive :-> She is so amazing music quality great can ask her a lot and she controls smart devices\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm so excited when I got Alexa. She is hands free assistance. While I'm cleaning, I can speak commands to her or just ask questions. It's amazing how you can dual task. I wish Alexa could work on voice command through the app though. Like a Siri. I also can't wait for the Echo Dot to be released next month. I need one in every room. I would definitely recommend this.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is much better than the fire tv, but also a little bit more expensive. It's worth it.\n",
      "Positive :-> We don't have cable at our home... We use this and it's great and saves us lots of money.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kids love it. Easy setup was ready with in minutes\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my grandson who cannot put it down. So nice to give a gift that is truly enjoyed!\n",
      "Positive :-> It's worth it for the shopping and todo lists alone. Great product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought the original Kindle a number of years ago and really enjoyed. This newer model is terrific. Fits comfortably in the hand and the readability is excellent. Downloading is even easier than before. I really enjoy using this product. Would definitely recommend!\n",

      "Positive :-> I bought my step mom an updated kindle. She reads the new kindle more than her old one.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 3 three of these for my boys for Christmas gifts. Great little tablet. Perfect for everything they want to use it for.\n",
      "Positive :-> The fiancé wanted one because she's a heavy reader and it's easy, convenient and portable. Was a only 40$, probably the best money I spent too make her happier.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Kindle Paperwhite 7th gen. Is perfect. Along with it and using Calibre software I can do anything with it. Very impressed.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have the firestick but once purchasing this firetv, the firestick is now in a spare room and the firetv is my main device downstairs. It's very quick with minimal lagging. If you have a decent IP you will be very satisfied with this product!\n",

      "Positive :-> I love it it is just awesome all the things you can do\n",
      "Positive :-> Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........\n",

      "Positive :-> Bought this for my elderly aunt. Was able to customize it so that it would be very simple to use for games. Amazon customer service is amazing.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo was on sale for $99 (marked down from $179) so I decided to buy it. I have the Google My Home but Alexa is better. It has 18000 words in its vocabulary.\n",

      "Positive :-> I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members).\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Echo does & is doing what it's supposed too. Works great\n",
      "Positive :-> I like how it plays music. It is perfect to connect to smart home products. Such as nest, Belkin , and many others. It is easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> We love our echo, not sure we use all the features yet but the shopping list feature is great as is all the different music we can now listen to!\n",
      "Positive :-> This new technology does what it's intended to do. My kids love it. They talk to Alexa every day, listen to music and even ask homework questions.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great entry-level tablet for the casual user looking for simple web browsing, email access, and low resolution media such as ebooks, streaming movies, and games. The hardware feels sturdy in your hand and the display boasts a scratch resistant surface as opposed to less durable products found in this price range. It isn't lightening fast but loads and runs most apps quickly and smoothly.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo works great and the sound is excellent. In addition to our household, we gave it as a gift to our kids families and everyone loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good if you're looking for a no frills internet experience. Very affordable.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased two at Christmas for my niece and nephew. They love them. They're safe for kids to use and easy. The only thing I dislike is the lack of control because of the fire software versus Android, but it's all good.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's the perfect tablet for a the price, does everything a more expensive tablet does.\n",
      "Positive :-> This amazon fire 7 tablet is good for web surfing.not so fast but its ok.\n",
      "Positive :-> Needed something smaller than a laptop to carry around. This is perfect.\n",
      "Positive :-> Enjoy using but sometimes Alexa struggles with answering questions. Nice to have not a must have. Definitely room for improvement.\n",
      "Positive :-> The fire tv is a great, reliable product. I have several including the fire stick. I can't say enough good things about them\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Echo is a great personal assistant. I find it more helpful than Siri on my iPhone. It can be used to set timers, work outs, and silly things like telling jokes plus much more. Also, it can be used to turn your home into a smart home which I have done with my lights. \"Alexa, turn on lights.\"\n",
      "Positive :-> This helps my high schooler when she needs help with homework.\n",
      "Positive :-> You can quickly amplify the voice of a lecture or turn it up for a party. Not only that, you can set alarms for naps with your voice and no longer have to worry whether your alarm is on.\n",
      "Positive :-> I originally purchased this as a gift for my daughter and quickly decided that I needed one for myself as well.For the price, you can't find a better screen on an e-reader. And the compact size makes it easy to take along with you anywhere. If you are thinking about the cheaper one, it's definitely worth the upgrade.\n",
      "Positive :-> The only bad thing I can say about this tablet is that after using certain apps you have to turn the tablet completely off in order to get to the main screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is perfect for my 4 year old. It needs an Sd card because the memory is low but it keeps him happy.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids are able to use this quite well. Can easily update all the applications.\n",
      "Positive :-> I heard nothing but good things about the fire tv. Although I had to ask around to see if someone could hook it up because it didn't come with instructions but overall I'm extremely happy.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. It is a great tablet. She loves it and it works great.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was the fourth ECHO we have purchased. The first one was for home, an award from RealtyUSA.com. The last three were Christmas presents for all the Grandchildren. they just love it. When we are out our dogs listen to classical music on the ECHO!\n",
      "Negative :-> I bought this tablet to connect to my hdtv. After not being able to get it to connect, I called Amazon customer care who informed me that this model doesn't connect to the tv, but the previous model (4th generation) does and that I should purchase the Amazon fire stick. Why the newer model does less...who knows. If you want to watch movies just on the tablet then it's a great buy, but didn't work for my purposes.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the Echo. Good speakers, great reminder and note taker. While listening to the radio while cooking dinner I also use it for a timer. It sits on my counter, taking up very little room. Love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Unit has fast response time. Graphics are very clear.\n",
      "Positive :-> I used to have a old version of kindle, and this one is a great improvement, the resolution is great and the backlight is especially convenient\n",
      "Positive :-> It is not a necessity but it is a good assistant. Lots of fun and entertains many guests. Very helpful in the kitchen.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best product in the market! I love it and recommended to everyone!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. I purchased it for its Playstation Vue and HBO Now streaming capabilities, as well as its ability to stream 4k programming. Nice if paired with an Amazon Prime subscription.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a gift for our daughter. We have downloaded movies and game to it for road trips. She loves it. Super fast. It works great. Picture is beautiful! Get it if you like good electronics on sale!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the firetv box. It is faster than the firestick, had more storage space n allows for ethernet cable connection for more stable connection. If u get a tv with roku built in there can be interference between box n tv. Dont get roku built in tv with this box.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got Fire tablet as an experiment. It was low cost and very compact but still and edge over my smart phone as far as screen size. Unit has worked flawlessly and has require minimum attention, but does a good job on email and recreational browsing.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is actually my second one in 2 years due to my boyfriend taking ownership of the first one.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great, have the firestick also, seems faster\n",
      "Positive :-> My grandson needed a new tablet. He had a Nabi for the last two years and had reached it's limit regarding storage. I found this tablet and decided I was the perfect choice because of the great price, memory, and it comes with a \"kid proof\" case.\n",
      "Positive :-> Don't know why I waited so long to purchase this! Thinking about cutting the cord to cable,( pricing is way to high.) Purchase of the fire tv is the first step. I love it there is so much to do. I am a prime member so a lot is included with my prime membership. Movies, tv shows and music, I just can't get enough. It has lived up to an d surpassed my expectations.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good tablet it was bought for my son who is 7 years old.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had one of these before, but I lost it in the divorce. I happily bought another one. They're so easy to carry around, and setup is trivial.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchase this tablet for my mother. Her first tablet to read books.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for the cord cutter. Very easy setup and user interface. Can add games and most apps for Android based.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you are a hardcore reader, this is your Kindle! The light makes a huge difference to read under any conditions, it´s a big improvement from the standard Kindle, if you are unsure between one or the other, go for the Paperwhite, it´s worth the extra money.\n",
      "Positive :-> Cheap, good always dependable tablet, now just useless words to take up minimum.\n",
      "Positive :-> Even with decreased vision, I can read this, and at night. The backlight is so helpful. Relatives who use this recommended it. Geek Squad were helpful in teaching me how to use it, since this is my first reader. Fits in my small purse and is so wonderful to have while waiting somewhere.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great addition to the home. So easy to set up and use. I love the shortcuts it has provided to my life.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a cheap tablet. I bought this so that my kids wouldn't ruin another IPad by crushing it. This tablet can stop working out of nowhere shut off and never turn on again. If it doesn't have a case and you drop it kiss this good bye because even a light drop can destroy it.\n",
      "Positive :-> The convience of the Amazon Echo is instantly noticable! This is the first step I've taken towards building a \"smarter\" home and am loving it. Being able to grab information by just talking to this device is wonderful. Granted I do feel a little silly having her tell me jokes whenever I am home alone...but that aside this is a great device. The Echo can sync up with Hue lights, nest thermastats, etc. and I can't wait to try that out! Make sure to get Geek Squad Protection! Yes it is a few more bucks, but why not protect your investment? I'm sure it'll come in handy when I need it too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful.\n",
      "Positive :-> wanted to keep up to date on latest technology ...\n",
      "Positive :-> My son is very happy for this tablet that I gave him for Christmas\n",
      "Positive :-> Have bought these for myself, grandkids and daughter. Nice size to put in purse and easy to take with you in car. Lots of uses for this.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had the first generation fire tv and I really don't see any reason to upgrade. Sure it has 4k support but only for Amazon movies, not Netflix. I returned this device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet for the price. Nothing flashy and does the job. Play games, search the Internet listen to music and watch movies.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had multiple Amazon Fire tablets. They are a great bargain. I love the ease of use and functionality. The only downfall is that it is really slow to charge.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loves this Kindle. It is so easy to upload new books and doesn't hurt your eyes while reading.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 7 year old daughter loves this tablet for games and watching Netflix and Hulu. Great size for her. I like the parental controls and easy to monitor her activity and how much time a day she can use it.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you're watching TV and playing games this is for you. Don't waste money on a iPad. This is great for reading too. Bought for a fireman spending long hours at the firehouse.\n",
      "Positive :-> This amazon fire tv was a great gift. many movies at your finger tips\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a good product to use I suggest people buy it\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for home improvement, and also playing music as a bluetooth speaker.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love Amazon Fire TV. Easy and simple to use and set-up.\n",
      "Positive :-> Far surpasses my expectations. Would definitely recommend it as a beginner tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet is great for the money. My boys still prefer the iPad but they still have fun on this tablet. Charge holds decent and selection of games is sufficient. Overall 4 out of 5 is solid given the value of this device.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is a great starter for a low cost!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> So far, I have used my Echo as a Bluetooth speaker. I have not interact with the device with my Amazon account (turning it off when not being use as a speaker).\n",
      "Positive :-> good product, takes some time to train it how to use our other smart divices.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it as a gift for my mom and it's simple enough to get done what she needs\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the size of this Kindle device. The battery lasts a very long time and charges quickly. Haven't found anything not to like about the Kindle Paperwhite.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fantastic product for a fantastic price and a fantastic service!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this speaker it sounds great and love controlling it without having to touch it\n",
      "Positive :-> Since I wasn't familiar with tablets, I had a little trouble navigating it, but the help section was a BIG help to me, as well as your staff. The tablet is doing exacting what I wanted and needed it for. I like the case that I bought to go with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for the price. Makes it easier to read with the contrast in text and background.\n",
      "Positive :-> I cut the cable and my bill with ooma for phone is 84$ a month for triple play\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased 3 of these for Christmas gifts for my son and 2 granddaughters. I purchased 2 different colors for the girls so they wouldn't fight and one for my son to replace a broken tablet. They all love them.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a must for every home. It's the perfect assistant. Can answer any question, plays thousands of songs, easy ordering of items off Amazon.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is easy to see and adjust font style and size. Great for reading at night.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my 2nd Amazon Fire and I prefer my previous one only because I don't care for all the advertisements that pop up while I'm trying to do things on this one. Otherwise, it has good speed, clear screen, and is easy to navigate.\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo learns as you use it. As you learn how to ask questions echo's answers get better.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this device. It has a host of information but you must ask the question in the correct order. The music library is really good. The jokes can be a little corny like all jokes. The alarm feature is good and the look and styling is outstanding\n",
      "Positive :-> The sound is amazing,will do many things like your shopping list,tell jokes and many other things...\n",
      "Positive :-> I have to confess, I am sure this thing is being underutilized. It is great for weather, Flash Briefings, and other pieces of information. IFTTT? Raspberry Pi? People tell me things they can do and I'm like, \"Hey, I'm getting Philips Hue to work. That's about as advanced as I'm going right now.\" Nevertheless, I do enjoy being able to call up my music from Amazon Prime Music, order pizza, and switch between my account and my wife's. Seriously enjoying it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best deal I have seen online. I checked Amazon and they were not as good.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my dad because he loves to read but, sometimes, it's difficult to get to the library in the Winter. So far, he's loving it.\n",
      "Positive :-> love the fire tv box. its faster and runs a little better than the firestick. Both are great products. love that you can add 3rd party apps to them for even more movie and tv options.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! I still can't get over how the kindle pages look like actual pages. Highly recommended for everyone!\n",
      "Positive :-> From what I can tell my kids love these. I do wish there was an option to keep it on the kids profile though\n",
      "Positive :-> It a great speaker and also a great personal assistant.\n",
      "Positive :-> easy hook up no fuse no hassle just plane easy plays music nice and loud the speakers are nice no distortion i enjoy it very must im glade i purchase this item\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my first Kindle. Previously I have owned several Nooks. The Voyage is lightweight and the built in dimming light works great. I would give it the edge over the Nook.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have plenty of Firesticks. This is an upgrade. Lets me stream faster because it has a faster processor. Family loves it. It knocks down the cable bills.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle Paperwhite does the job it is supposed to do, but noticeably slower than the methods I have used previously (iPad, computer, phone). I think Amazon needs to bump up the processing power of this device to compete with other tablets and devices. I would recommend this to a friend, but with some reservation.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great device to have and use. I have two\n",
      "Positive :-> but it is missing some of the Google apps. I have not sideloaded those yet. The display is acceptable. If you have Amazon Prime, it does have a nice interface for using it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had this tablet for several months now and have had no problems with it. 8 in screen is perfect easy to hold, not too big or too small. 16GB ROM(about 12gb available after updates and built in apps) is good if you don't have a lot of apps or games. The RAM could be bigger but it doesn't lag even with some medium gaming. 1.5ghz processor is not for heavy gaming, but for everyday use is great. The battery life is excellent I would say easily 8 hours or 5 to 6 if gaming. While this is not a HD display the colors are sharp, some glare if in the sun. Camera sucks but decent for the price, no issues connecting and syncing my data to my Amazon account. If you are an Amazon Prime member definitely buy this tablet and even if you aren't this tablet gives you a lot for the price. I wish Amazon would offer more than 90 day warranty but overall very impressed and satisfied with my purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> We got the FireTV because a friend recommended it to us. We were stick of our cable bill constantly going up and this was the best optio! It's a onetime purchase fee and you can download an App called Kodi and you can watch live Tv, previously played shows, and movie you can think of and even sports. Granted sometimes the quality isn't the best, it's free!! We were paying almost $200 for cable and Internet and now I pay $60 for internet and nothing to stay up with my shows and sports!! Best purchase I have made in a long time!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great apps, excellent price, my kids really enjoy it\n",
      "Positive :-> Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is by far my favorite tablet on the market. Has all that high priced tablets ioffer\n",
      "Positive :-> Looked for a tablet for reading books and light web surfing. This fits that need.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the echo for everything from music to weather\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire is great for reading my Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven't ck'd out what else I can do with it, but I'm sure there is a lot.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it's just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this thing it does everything you can even play games on it\n",
      "Positive :-> Was given a Kindle from Best-Buy stock.... it was white but from the package labeling you can't tell the color and return it.Got the BLACK KINDLE... college student son loves it for all the class reading he has to do..... connects to college wifi seamlessly and downloads the syllabus and assigned readings.Easy to carry and read indoors or outdoors.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was pretty hesitant at first when looking to purchase a Kindle. There is just something about having a physical book in your hands while reading and seeing the progress in how far you've gotten into the book. Being a person who is always reading on the go, at work, and in the dark at home when others are sleeping, the Kindle has been awesome.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my mother. She thought it would be good for calendar and reminders. After setting up and installing a few extra apps, she seems to enjoy it, but mostly using it for music, weather, etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> Tap is a versatile device that serves as a music repository with on demand playback features and surprisingly high quality sound. AI app Alexa responds to commands and requests for information promptly with some occasional minor glitches. Overall a handy and very portable device for quality music playback and as a knowledge base access tool,\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up and very simple to use.very light and compact.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product at low price... and very good image resolution\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great! Super fast and does everything one would want.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was giving the tablet as a gift for Christmas to a 3 year old. I initially purchased the \"standard version\" but returned it for the kid version which included a \"Bumper box\" as well as a 2 year warranty, which the standard version did not have. Thankfully, I asked the parent of the child if it was OK for me to set it up prior to giving it to the child. The set up took some time. I was thankful that I read the reviews because I bought an additional memory card since the product only has 8GB of storage. The child was able to open the gift and \"play\" immediately as a result of doing up-front work. One thing I noted that when the child played a movie through Netflix, the resolution was not very good. Could be an adjustment needed in the tablet, which has yet to be worked out. I would recommend this, but if giving as a gift for a child, I would recommend doing the up-front work so it is ready to go for the child when they receive it.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a great gadget for children when going on trips, also traveling\n",
      "Positive :-> glad I got this kindle. can take it with me, and I can actually see the screen\n",
      "Positive :-> good deal . purchased for my mother , killer mothers day present. get what you pay for\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent value and popular for all ages.Great for reading books and browsing the internet\n",
      "Positive :-> I like this tablet a lot. I now own 3 of them and feel good that I can have one close to the tv. If I step on it and crush it I am only out a few bucks. It is clearly not as nice as my ipad, but I can get 10 of these for what one I device costs. I use it to watch tv, read, and surf the web. As a sports fan, sometimes I line all three up so I can watch three games at once.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexia is so convient, love music so she makes me so happy. I have not tried the other options of getting the light fixture attachments to turn on and off lights.\n",
      "Positive :-> Lots of stuff available to add to enhance performance.\n",
      "Positive :-> This suited my exact needs which was a mobile way of watching netflix.\n",
      "Positive :-> Seems smaller than the older version but it still does the job. User friendly.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the kindle for my son he go to the college he like\n",
      "Positive :-> unit must be charged frequently still trying to learn the fire\n",
      "Positive :-> I know I can pay to get rid of the ads but it's just a bad idea, tablet works fine otherwise. And if your okay with Amazon apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my echo! I use it to listen to music and the timer the most. Its nice to get the weather and to use it w/ the Hue Lights to cut lights off and on. My daughter loves the tell a joke feature.\n",
      "Positive :-> BYE BYE CABLE TV, KODI ON THE FIRE TV TAKES OVER..YES SIR\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this product. My kids love it. It is very to use and has a nice display.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well while in the kitchen are covered in food.\n",
      "Positive :-> overall good but voice control does not work yet. support is not easily obtained to resolve the issue - it still does not work\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a great decent device to have around, super fast streaming without getting over heated.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality!\n",
      "Positive :-> User friendly, affordable, nice features, good battery life\n",
      "Neutral :-> Worth for what you pay for.. Basic use is ok......\n",
      "Positive :-> Good purchase for the money but the screen is smaller than I anticipated.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my fourth Kindle; one was lost, but the other two simply died after a few years. I resent paying good money for something which such a short lifespan. A kindle is a great aide for readers who travel. How else to take dozens of books along? But I wish they were more long lived.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's simple to instal and use. I cannot believe how they can develop those kind of things.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great Tablet for the Price. It was on sale for $39. I was surprised by its quickness.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought it as a replacement for a broken tablet. There are several apps I'd like to add to it that are not available, and it won't update the Facebook app so I wind up using my phone for many things that I used to do on my tablet. If it wasn't a good e reader, it would be worthless, but I do read on it a lot, so I'm keeping it but I would still like a new tablet - which is disappointing.\n",
      "Positive :-> It meet my expectations. It performs well compared to other tables. I am very satisfied with the product and it quality. Lastly, it worth the price I paid for.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for My Mom for downloading books and games, she LOVES it, very easy to set up and use, Great product!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo does exactly as advertised. It will tell you the weather, jokes and some fun facts. using the skills you can add different features and for the most part they work. For it to really be big it has to continue to add features that the everyday user has an interest in. If you don't get the wording just right echo will not carry out the command. in the skills set you always have to start with a common phrase to get it to understand. This could be a pain because if you forget the exact phrase it will not work. Overall a great product well made and has great potential to be the star of the home automation.\n",
      "Positive :-> My three year old son love it. He can read and learn so much from the free time app.\n",
      "Positive :-> She says this was the best gift she ever received.\n",
      "Positive :-> I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.\n",
      "Positive :-> I USE THE ECHO FOR MUSIC, GAMES, TRIVIA, AND FOR SMART LIGHTING. IT'S AWESOME .\n",
      "Positive :-> We got the Alexa on sale for $150 my wife enjoys putting music on whenever she wants I enjoy the information I can get\n",
      "Positive :-> It was affordable and it works great I hope it stays that way\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the Echo. Alexa is my new favorite gadget. Can't wait to update the house\n",
      "Positive :-> this is another gift for a friend who enjoyed very much.\n",
      "Positive :-> Overall a good tablet. The screen is crisp enough to enjoy videos. The only downside is the built in speakers. Even with headphones, the sound quality isn't top notch. Just average. If you're not looking to do anything fancy. It's a good deal.\n",
      "Positive :-> You really can't go too wrong with this purchase because of the price. Works very well, but don't expect iPad quality. Does everything I've asked of it, but some web pages are harder to read partially because of it's small size (which can be handy) and it's lower resolution. It's a good second tablet and is better watching a movie on, then a smaller phone. Can throw it in a small travel bag and not feel you have to be quite so careful with it as you might be with a more expensive tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent and affordable product. It came as advertised. Not top of the line, but not at the end of the line. More than a fair product. Good and fast.Can handle almost all thrown at it. Resolution is passable.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this box, plenty of power for my 60in tv, beautiful picture and sound. Key features for me were the internet hardline even though the wifi in this unit works great and the usb. Easily add on a usb keyboard to make your experience that much better.\n",
      "Positive :-> After your initial kindle library download, the battery should last 2-3 weeks with the backlight close to the highest setting.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love all the things Alexa can help with. Playing music and grocery list are my favs.\n",
      "Positive :-> The kids wanted to get this for their mom this year. I was somewhat skeptical but went along with it. My wife opened it up and the kids showed her how to use it. She absolutely loves it. She starts her morning off by checking the weather before getting the kids ready for school. She then either plays music or news depending on what her mood is in the morning. She likes the fact that she can just ask for an artist or a type of music and it plays. This time the kids were correct.This is amazingly easy to use. You only need to speak what you want. It answers most questions. You can give it items to put on a shopping list. You can then access those items from the Alexa app on your phone. No more paper lists.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the 6 inch Fire HD and liked it; however his tablet is a better value. It not only lets you access all of the Amazon features, but it allows you to expand the memory for greater storage. Great value for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> My brother-in-law and his family have enjoyed it very much. He says finding songs is better and faster than Pandora\n",
      "Positive :-> This echo simplifies my daily life activities and is worth every penny.\n",
      "Positive :-> Since I am more of an Apple Buckie, I wish this had more integration to my iTunes Library. I use it with my LifeX lights, get the news and weather. Not sure I would buy it again, but if you are a Google Buckie then it would be a great toy\n",
      "Positive :-> This does anything you can imagine, you really don't need cable\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loves this tablet. Uses it for Netflix!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the second kindle my daughter has been using and its been good.\n",
      "Positive :-> One of the first steps in to my smart home, so far i love them. Only bad is when the AWS servers go down my connected devices wont talk with alexa.\n",
      "Positive :-> The words on the screen are very clear. If a hardcopy book's type is too small I can read it on kindle because I can make the size bigger. Read many positive reviews of the ease of use, page turner, special functions and clear display that I was convinced to buy the kindle voyage\n",
      "Positive :-> Thank You. Great Product for all ages. Thank You!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Super clear and crisp sound very clear and if you like it loud this speaker rocks\n",
      "Positive :-> Second kindle I use it for reading,games,internet,and shopping\n",
      "Positive :-> Anyone should be able to run this tablet its really easy to use and good quality for low price\n",
      "Positive :-> It's not the fastest tablet, but it's fine for what I use it for. Camera is not that great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my wife for Christmas after reading the reviews. Hands down the best e-reader for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this product and use it every day. Easy to set up and connect to\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my tablet. It exceeds my expectations. Doesnt have Google but i make due since i primarily use it for Kindle\n",
      "Positive :-> This paperwhite has a sharp display (300 ppi) and adjustable brightness levels. It is extremely easy to hold when reading. Included in the box was the Paperwhite device, a USB cord, and quick start guide. No power adapter was supplied but I use the one for my cellphone and it works fine. One charge holds me for about 3-4 weeks.The ads are not as intrusive as I thought they would be however I am displeased with the quality of the \"special offers.\" I have found better offers just by searching the web.Also you cannot listen to audible books on this device. It is reading only but that doesn't bother me.Overall this is an excellent device. Since purchasing this I have quadrupled the number of books that I read in a month's time. I highly recommend it to any avid reader.\n",
      "Positive :-> I picked this up Oma deal of the day. Took a little learning, but man is this thing great for travel! Does backlight reading and plays my digital movies. Great all around tablet!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is GREAT for my 3 year old and my 5 year old! They stay entertained and easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Convenient, functional, practical device! I loved this product!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great addition to any technological home. We don't use it all the time but we use it daily. It has a hard time recognizing my location when we ask for the weather, but we can ask for our city weather and we get it. We use the note taking quiet frequently for calling out what we need for groceries. It plays music that we ask. Now we must get some of the switches and plugs for controlling your lights and home automation. That will be a while, but it is still cool to know it is there as an option. Overall this is a cool toy for the whole family.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have no issues with product. Daughter seems to love it\n",
      "Positive :-> We purchased the Echo originally when it was first available for prime members only. At the time it felt like a novelty toy and didn't do much. Since that time, it has had major advancements in it's capabilities. We now use it to control our lights, music as well as a personal digital assistant. I recently purchase one for my parents for Christmas, and they're loving it too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product that does the basics. Too bad you have to buy a specific light control or security system to make this useful. My Smart TV's are connected to the internet, so why not control them too? But I was impressed when I asked \"Alexa, whats on TV for the Olympics tonight?\" and the response was Swimming at xx time, Gymnastics at yy time. Far more info than the TV guide on screen showing only a 4 hour block on NBC. It is the beginning of things to come.\n",
      "Positive :-> I appreciate the ease of use and the flexibility of the FIRE. Also its portability.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased 2 of these to gift to my granddaughters, and they absolutely love them. It's just the right size for them to comfortable hold.\n",
      "Positive :-> Surprised my husband with the Amazon Echo. He is enjoying learning all about its capabilities\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a good tablet to have. The books are good...\n",
      "Positive :-> A friend recommended the tablet and I am happy with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads.\n",
      "Positive :-> great tablet for kids but a lot of ads , for someone who wants a cheap tablet that more or less can do all stuff this is a good choice\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I would recommend this product it's very helpful. I purchased the dot for my daughter. Alexa helps her with spelling words and more.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great that you can get these in different colors to differentiate from the other one!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have already got 2 from Best Buy before this is my third one\n",
      "Positive :-> Loads TV, movies, applications very smoothly fast. Easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire TV is use easy to use. I has everything you need and tons of apps!\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is totally worth buying. It's perfect for someone who likes to play games or read.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to learn and use. The device does a great job clearing understanding you with out having to talk funny\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this Kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire. I would give it an excellent rating if the camera were better but the pictures come out grainy and not very clear. Great for watching shows and videos and these are very clear.. Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend's 8yr old daughter. She absolutely loves it, and it was easy to set up and use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very useful for night time reading responsive and intuitive display\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a nice idea if you have a need for such a gadget. My opinion was it wasn't worth the money. Computers and smart phones do mostly the same thing so why have an additional gadget. It might be more worthwhile for someone that wants to use it for running smart gadgets around the house. Not for me so I returned it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one.\n",
      "Positive :-> Does everything my daughter needs to do as far as playing games\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my 11 year old son and he absolutely loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it, I use my ECHO to play old school music, control the temp in my house and to get my morning brief as well as set my alarms.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire TV is a good device with a powerful processor and the best Playstation Vue interface. However, it can be frustrating to access the channels you've added as you have to either search for the channel or thumb through them all - one by one. The Roku allows you to arrange your channels in whatever order you choose. The Roku has the most channel options - including Vudu (a channel not available on the Fire TV). Still, if you intend to use the Playstation Vue service you'll be much happier with the Fire TV.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my daughter 2nd birthday and she absolutely love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Compared to products of the same, my Amazon Echo is the very best!! Ordering through Best Buy was effortless & efficient.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the Kindle. Very useful when traveling outside house to friends.\n",
      "Positive :-> IN LOVE WITH THE FIRESTICK. SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT AND THE PRICE WAS NOT BAD FOR WHAT IS OFFERS.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading\n",
      "Positive :-> Needed a new kindle and this fit the bill. Enjoy reading on a kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon tablet great gift, love the 6 pack gift idea\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire TV has been a great addition to my home theater. It has a polished interface, and quality feeling remote. I especially appreciate the fact that there's an ethernet port included on the Fire TV. Overall, I have been very satisfied with the Fire TV.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was originally paranoid of these always listening devices but then I discovered what could be done with home automation and I was hooked. I now have 3 echos, an echo dot, and 3 dash wands. I can control my lights and tv now with my voice! The echo sounds fantastic playing music as well. Really cool devices.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an excellent value. This is easy to read, easy to use and performs like a champ. If you want an all around great reader but don't want to pay a high price, this is the one.\n",
      "Positive :-> You get what you pay for with this kindle fire. Excellent as a Kindle for reading books, but not great for using the Internet. I am used to using another tablet which is much quicker and I was frustrated using the Kindle... It doesn't measure up to other tablets. Still worth the $ for a decent reading device.\n",
      "Positive :-> The lady that helped me was very professional and knowledgeable. She understood what I was looking for let me know that she would have to order it. She did just that and it showed up 2 days earlier than originally told.\n",
      "Positive :-> The paper white is great after a day on the computer at work. It's so much easier on my eyes than a tablet. Love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for grandkids learning to read. Have found lots of kids books. They love them\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent performance, Alexa really performs, outperforms apple and roku.\n",
      "Positive :-> Saw this on TV decided to look into it purchased it and loved it\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves his tablet! It's easy for him to use and he enjoys all the games that come with it. No problem with the storage or speed of apps. I previously bought him the Samsung tablet and when that broke it was difficult to get it fixed. I like that Amazon gives you a two year warranty.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this after trying the Insignia 8\" tablet which unfortunately had a charging problem. The graphics on this tablet are OK, though the contrast is not as good as the Insignia's or other more expensive tabs.Integration with Amazon for reading is excellent. Tablet is responsive and speedy. Construction is sturdy and heavier than the Insignia. The Silk browser runs well for all the sites I visit.\n",
      "Positive :-> You cannot beat this price. I was looking for an inexpensive tablet for my kids and the Fire 7 worked perfectly. They strictly use it for games, but the Fire 7 has allowed me to monitor what they are downloading and will filter out content that I select as inappropriate. Plus, all this is linked to my Amazon account. GREAT PRODUCT!\n",
      "Positive :-> we wanted to have echo to join our Alexa experience and also to help out with our grandchildren as they love soothing music as well as enjoy talking with Alexa. Love the design and white color of the unit.\n",
      "Positive :-> I would highly reconmnd this product to anybody. I use it on a daily basis\n",
      "Positive :-> My 6 year old loves it easy to use has lots of apps\n",
      "Positive :-> It's great for the price but always freezes and stalls maybe it's just nine since I put a 32gb memory card in there so it takes time to load. The price makes it worth it and the fact that you expand the memory to what you want\n",
      "Positive :-> Text is very crisp and easy to read. Would recommend to others\n",
      "Positive :-> Great features if you're looking for a reader and not a tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love to read and this Kindle Paperwhite is great. And being a Bookbub member. I get free books automatically loaded to my Kindle. And borrowing books from the library is eady and trouble free.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Top movies, anytime, just your choice. Old movies!\n",
      "Positive :-> For the price this is a great value, I considered a laptop, or larger tablets but am quite satisfied with this purchase\n",
      "Positive :-> I thought about purchasing a Samsung tablet also, however I do like to read as well. I saw several reviews that have a negative view because of the Amazon software and that it is not stock Android.However, I have installed the Play Store (you can find instructions online) and I am very happy with this tablet. I would definitely recommend it. Also I have had 10\" tablets before, and this one is just the right size.\n",
      "Positive :-> Improvements over earlier 10\" kindles. Only need a case or stand .\n",
      "Positive :-> Needed something to use when out and about and this was perfect\n",
      "Positive :-> Love Kindle fire bought for an elderly friend and she just love the ease of use.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great low end tablet and it is sold at an amazing price.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased 2 one for my wife the other for my college aged daughter both are enjoying the product immensely !\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my 3rd Kindle. Need I say more? I have not been disappointed with this product and the value of the product is better each time I purchase it!\n",
      "Positive :-> If you want a tablet but on a budget, go for this.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is a great product. She seems to know everything, whether its math, music,sports, it just doesn't matter. I think my wife is jealous of her because I spend too much time with her(Alexa).\n",
      "Positive :-> I NEEDED this as part of my SmartThings home automation system. I was waiting for a sale and got this when it was $50 off.It does everything that the manual said that it will do, works great.A bonus is that, alongst with using it to control my automation, I can also use it as a bluetooth speaker. And it sounds great.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my 3rd Kindle. I absolutely love it. The best feature I have found on it is the \"BlueShade\" option, which changes the light levels for when reading at night. Also you cannot beat the price. May be purchasing another one for my son in the near future!\n",
      "Positive :-> Keyboard is a must for ease of use. Sometimes apps don't want to close.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use this item everyday. It can be for the time, play music on Spotify, weather, anything. I have the Echo and the Echo dot.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for my little brother. He was used to Google's Android operating system. This tablet runs on Amazon's system, but is more user friendly. He loves this tablet and it was easy for him to learn.\n",
      "Positive :-> Get up to the minute news traffic and weather reports. Answers general questions, and the speaker quality is great for music.\n",
      "Positive :-> Paperwhite is light. Light feature is a must for night readers. No paper! No more trips to the library. The library is in your hands. 8 months and counting with no issues! Can't go wrong with amazon products! Why are you still reading this review? Go to your local best buy and purchase me the amazon kindle paperwhite now!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a replacement machine. Good reading experience. Great for travel - and reading in bed.\n",
      "Positive :-> it is not free everything . have to pay and had return it to best buy store . wish free everything without cents . sorry\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to use. My bf loves it. Good price.recommend it\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this tablet! It does everything! Accesses the web, downloads apps, games, music, movies,. You name it. I also purchased a cover and stylus pens for this tablet. For under $80 you wont find a better deal!\n",
      "Positive :-> Worth the price. Very light and love that it's personal\n",
      "Positive :-> Great mini tablet. Clear video. Excellent reading. Very easy to learn.\n",
      "Positive :-> Super easy to install to your hdmi. Just signup for a Amazon account and you are off to the best streaming experience.\n",
      "Positive :-> Ok, so I will not say its perfect but it is really close, I bought it for my wife to have endless music... Yes its great.... But then I connected it to my home automation and I will say it really nice not to have to get up to turn on or off light in a room again...Constant updates keep me interested.\n",
      "Positive :-> My special needs 8 yr old has gone through two ipads at $200.00 each. The Amazon Fire Kids Edition is such a better option. It is loaded with thousands of appropriate options for games and movies without having to download or pay for individual apps. I can even use it in adult mode. I'm very happy with this purchase and highly highly recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> All my friends had the Amazon Fire Stick but I was not sold on streaming video since am a crazed videophile. When I read about the FireTV I decided I was ready to try it out. I must say that I've become a huge fan of YouTube and the video quality of some content in 4k is amazing. This is a good upgrade over the FireStick.\n",
      "Positive :-> I loved this tablet Has games and is super fast. Great tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this tablet for my nephew and have downloaded a lot of educational apps from the Amazon store.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have more than one and am glad I ordered another. You can never have too many USB chargers.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love that this guy supports 4K content since I just recently bought a 4K TV. Please be aware that if you don't already have an Amazon account, you'll have to set one up before using it. You can set it up through the Fire TV, but It'd be best if you just do it through a computer because the process to set up the account through the device I tedious and frustrating at times.\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo is fun to play with, but doesn't understand a lot of questions and the \"skills\" don't work if you don't use the correct wording. The app needs some work bc you have to look through all of the skills to find the right questions, you can't just search the skills that are enabled. I'm sure that it will get better with time, but for now, it's fun to have around.\n",
      "Positive :-> This unit works great. We ditched cable and this is a great alternative. We have had no problems with this unit.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased he Fire because you can do more with it. I have an Apple TV (2nd gen) and I enjoyed it, but was looking for something a little faster. So far it's been great. Being able to side load other apps has been great and the Amazon Prime content is pretty good.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've purchased 3 tablets so far as gifts.I've gotten great feedback on all purchases. The price was affordable and easy to operate for 2 eight year olds.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excelent tablet for kids, easy to use and good parental protection\n",
      "Positive :-> This is installed in a sewing room in lieu of a cable box with a monthly fee. She uses it with prime movies and tv shows (best of all, I don't have to watch)I did set it up and tried voice search. It works great>\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner. Keeps him busy.\n",
      "Positive :-> We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature\n",
      "Positive :-> Just got this for Christmas so I haven't got to use it a lot. Can't wait to learn more about it and use it more.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet for our 6 year old son for Christmas to play games and take pictures along with a unicorn beetle defender case and it has totally exceeded our expectations! Totally worth the little bit of money you spend!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great piece of hardware...I love it. really good all around..\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is great for games and music. My son enjoys playing games and music on this device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Lightweight, and I like being able to read outside with no glare.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use and love the voice feature. Had roku's before and liked them. Think I like this even better.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for reading but enjoy all the features from books to movies\n",
      "Positive :-> I like having the option of a tablet. The one thing I overlooked is it did not have internal microphone program, but that only limited the translator apps. My cell phone has the same app, so no biggie. Nice tablet at a bargain.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for a gift for my nephew and he loved it!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter would not read before she got her kindle. She love this and now reads all the time. Books are cheaper and less space needed in your home. Great games.\n",
      "Positive :-> Enjoyable to have so much music so readily available. Also great to have songs from back in the day so readily available. Having a weather forecast at voice command helps things run more smoothly in the morning. Very convenient to have a timer available even though your hands are sticky with dough or meatloaf. The ap is also good for finding new skills.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle Fire is a great tablet and reader. Everything you need in a tablet at a much lower price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy setup. Confusing screens but practical and inexpensive.\n",
      "Positive :-> Still learning to use the Echo. My new friend Alexa is very informative and fun. Great sound too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet but after about a year it starts acting up and you cannot get help from Amazon to fix it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Really love this. My only issue is that there are benefits to being an amazon music service member and I don't want another provider. Still great though with the other services that connect.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Quick Easy setup, fun & We use it all the time! Checking our commute, weather, jokes, recipes, to helpful to mention it all!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased for my younger children to do learning games. My last one purchased was for a 4 year old and she loves it. Very durable.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well. Easy to install. Great features include Alexa, connection to Amazon, Netflix, movies I can't find elsewhere, music, and more\n",
      "Positive :-> The FireTV is definitely faster than the Firestick and the performance is most noticeable when navigating across both native and third party menus. Relative to the Roku, the amazon user interface is lacking and a bit cumbersome to navigate. But all that doesn't really matter if you're getting it for the same reason I did--Kodi.\n",
      "Positive :-> I loved the Amazon Fire stick but I enjoy the speed and 4k support of this product over the Fire Stick. I have owned and tested AppleTv (1st Gen), Boxee, Roku 4k, Chromecast, Nexus player, and by far the Amazon Fire Tv and stick offer the most and best content; much of which can be used for free. Great layout, easy to use and full of features.\n",
      "Positive :-> Despite of being a good idea, it lacks some logic or connectivity.Most of the questions non-related to the Amazon universe don't have an answer. Although if you have a smart home/devices the functionality grows up exponentially.\n",
      "Negative :-> This item is taking forever to charge and not holding the charge. We may have to return. I assume it is this unit and not all.\n",
      "Positive :-> I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my mother in law as her first tablet, she loves it! Great value.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this device. Small footprint, but tons of options.\n",
      "Positive :-> Use it everyday for getting weather forecasts, laughing at jokes and so much more!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the Amazon Echo. We are having so much fun with it and it was so easy to set up. We're still learning all it can do. I was very satisfied with Best Buy's service and delivery also.\n",
      "Positive :-> We looked into tablets for three of our children for Christmas. There were three things we looked for: the ability to use it for books, games and videos and our ability to control the activity. The kindle fire gave us all those and more. I love that we can increase the storage when/ if we want to. I love that we can control play time. I was concerned because all of our kids were used to our iPad, but they have had no issues adjusting to the change. We are extremely happy with this purchase!!\n",
      "Positive :-> One of the simplest tablets probably out there, only good for those that want to get into Amazon.com shopping. Good value for bargain proce.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet has so many apps with games, movies, and books that it keeps my nephew entertained for hours on end.\n",
      "Positive :-> Look no Further, fast processor, great ram , expandable storage turn your tv into a smart tv\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it, great quality. Nice picture, so good. !!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> The product is very durable and is great for children\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle Fire's are a great product to own. We own 2 and our whole family enjoys them. Easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids love there Fire. They cannot put it down. They love being able to download books and read them right from their tablet.\n",
      "Neutral :-> 4out of the 6kindles I purchased does not work. the date and time will not set properly therfore it is unable to connect to the wifi. contacted amazon, they acknowledged the problem but directed me back to best buy since they have a 30day back return policy on this product. Well I am unable to make it back into the store by the time the return policy is up.\n",
      "Positive :-> The set up and installation were easy to do. The quality of the products is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love, love my Echo. At a command it will play any songs my mood dictates at that moment.\n",

      "Positive :-> So good I bought 2 of them. Super fast and tons of movies to choose from\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my younger daughter and for her it is great. Plenty of things for her to do whether it's games, or looking up stuff for school, or watching youtube videos.\n",

      "Positive :-> A gift for my grandsons. They love it! Easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> Works awesome. Was hesitant at first not sure how it works but after playing around with it for a while you figure out all the cool things it can do.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my kindle I take it everywhere with me. It's lightweight fits in my purse just great deal!\n",
      "Positive :-> First one had issues from the update that was loaded upon installation. Returned and waited several weeks before buying a replacement. Seems to work better.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this size. It fits in my purse perfect. Love all the features it offers. The price was the best part.\n",
      "Positive :-> They've done a great job with the voice recognition and it works with so many different services and has so many capabilities. Loving Alexa\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought it for my 2 (almost 3) year old. He really lover it. I love that I can put a timer on it and he can't be on it all day. It's easy to use. The only thing I hate is how fast the battery runs down even if not in use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my wife as a replacement for a Fire purchased a few years ago. She likes this better\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is easy to use and is better than any tv service u could get\n",
      "Positive :-> I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this thing its freakin awesome to own and fun\n",
      "Positive :-> We got each boy one and they love it. Easy for all ages :)\n",
      "Positive :-> I find it very helpful in finding music from years ago. I also find useful in getting the weather for Downey.,California.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet for my brother for Xmas and he loved it. He is able to watch Netflix on his tablet. Recommend it for kids. I will be buying my sister one now too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for kids! It's very easy for them to navigate.\n",
      "Positive :-> excellent device, very fast especially when connected to ethernet\n",
      "Positive :-> I own a Chromecast and didn't think I would need this. How wrong I was! The Amazon Fire TV box is more functional and useful than the Chromecast. It is easy to travel with and as long as you have a solid Internet connection (wired or wireless), you can enjoy this device. This was a great purchase and I highly recommend it! So nice I bought it twice!\n",
      "Positive :-> I was able to nab this tablet for 40 bucks on sale and it's a great vacation tablet. There is a lot less pressure in losing this tablet and it fills all my basic needs of accessing Facebook, reading books, accessing internet and playing the occasional game. It's also the perfect tablet for the kids after purchasing a good case for it. 40 dollar tablet and they lose it? Drop in the bucket compared to losing/breaking a 300 dollar iPad.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this when it was on sale which is what really made it worth getting.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's cool but it's kind of slow. I don't feel it's worth $119. Maybe like 70\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for a Christmas gift. Works great for anything we have tried to use it for. Great reader!\n",
      "Positive :-> Affordable tablet for kids to use. Great deal!!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this item because I just love all electronics\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it, had Roku 2,3 and this replaced all of them. Would high recommend this over Fire Stick, faster and can add extra memory...Cut cable and use this as our primary tv source along with antenna for local channels kid love as well very easy to use...\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price and great for young one and a good tablets for beginners\n",
      "Positive :-> My tablet is great and my kids love it's there Christmas gift. Now they can leave my iPad alone for now on.\n",
      "Positive :-> this was a gift for my mom, she loves it!!! works great\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire Tv was quick and easy to set up. After signing in with my prime account my son was able to watch a bunch of shows and movies!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!\n",
      "Positive :-> I only had a chance to download one movie and I was impressed with clarity of pic\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love my Fire tablet. Great size, lots of space and a great reader. I can't recommend this product enough.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device! Fast response with remote control. Great voice recognition! Very reliable in terms of connectivity. Streaming 4k is a big plus. Overall great product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Well done Amazon - easy to set up and use - well made product.\n",
      "Positive :-> yeeeeaaaahhhhh kids love this and so do i...thanks again\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use and the HD is awesome. The simplicity as well as the easy to follow directions to set it up is great. It does everything I want it to do.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product and integrates well with the Amazon suite of products. Closing in on Apple Ipad\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my 7 year old so he could play games on those looooooong hockey game car rides -- this tablet was more than enough for what we needed and the app selection is good in the Amazon store! No complaints here!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for kids. Lots of games and books for kids..\n",
      "Positive :-> Super easy to use. Love how it's voice activated so it is convenient\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up. The parental controls and safety features make this a great purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is one of the best product amazon have on the market now, very fast and reliable.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use, and worth the money. Lots of movies and other features\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this fire for someone as a Christmas gift and it was the best gift given that day. It is perfect for any small online tasks one would like to do and absolutely perfect for reading books!\n",
      "Positive :-> Have a 7\", wanted a bigger screen. This is perfect and price was great.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids love these. I purchased 3 of them at one time. They seem really durable.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my first ereader. I've wanted one for awhile but wasn't impressed with features until the two most recent versions of Paperwhite were released (I have the latest version). I've read a few books and several magazines on it, so at this point I'm familiar with it. Basic functionality is excellent. For reading text it's pretty straightforward; magazine articles with images worked well for me, but I can see where screen formatting could be an issue for more complex illustrations. The backlight is very good (I wouldn't buy an ereader without it). Pages flips are lightening fast, and the touch screen is mostly quite responsive with minimal pressure (I have a few complaints, see below). Nice integration with the Amazon leather cover, you can just close the book and it shuts down. Buying books from Amazon is simple, and they are delivered via my home WiFi in seconds. Battery life seems endless, and recharge is simple (the included cable charges via a PC, wall charger is an accessory you must purchase). Great device for older readers, as you can kick up the font size and lighting for squint-free reading. It's about the size of a small paperback book and as light as a feather.My complaints: 1) Ads are mildly annoying, it's aggravating to pay more for an ad-free version; 2) Availability of books from my local library remain shockingly limited, even though these devices are hardly new; 3) The Amazon library for book loans (available for a monthly fee) is also very limited. I had a 30-day trial period, during which time I searched for several classic novels on both Amazon and my local library -- big fat zero across the board for my entire reading list. Want to read Catch-22 or Atlas Shrugged? You've got to buy it. ; 4) Highlighting is clumsy using a finger, although I've improved over time. Changing the highlighted area by dragging the electronic tabs is useless; 5) If you like to flip through a book, the Paperwhite will take you to the furthest page touched when you reopen the book. If you've read 50 pages, but went forward to see something on pages 180-190, you'll return to 191 next time. If you flip around a lot you'll get a real mess. Manual bookmarks are the only solution. 6) It's my understanding that when you buy a book from Amazon, you are getting a license to read that book on an Amazon device only (you are not getting a generic ebook that will work forever on any device). So if you buy a different brand of ereader 5 years from now you'll have to rebuy your library.Despite all this, I'm glad I bought it and would recommend it if you'd like a dedicated ereader versus a tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for myself and I am enjoying it. I like all of the information I can get. I also like that it can play music that I picked out and give me interesting facts for the day. I have it set up that I can get soothing sounds when I want to just relax. I am still learning everything that it can do.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product for a young child to play with without breaking\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent item.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you know anything about the android OS and what you can run on it this is the device for you!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love listening to music and awesome tell play certain radio stations or music to enjoy as I work. Took a little getting used to know how phase questions to get Alexa to answer but we are both are pro now. :)\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this tablet. It was a great buy. I would strongly recommend buying it. It's a great reader but also good for surfing the web.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product, works really well...love it....\n",
      "Positive :-> Had a very, very old Kindle so this was quite a change. Like the size, the paperwhite (didn't think I would) and the back-lighting..\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect size for me. Speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet especially for the price. The only draw back is that I could not load an app that I needed for work because Kindle does not accept google play apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> We don't have cable tv so this is a great way to get to see shows and rent movies\n",
      "Positive :-> PROS: - A MUST for Amazon Prime subscribers - lots of media content - For PlayStation Vue subscribers, it's speedy and fast; works great- Noticeably faster than 1st generation Amazon Fire Stick- High-quality feel of the remote control- Smartphone App works great- Alexa-enabled CONS:- Vudu app is not supported by Amazon- Not compatible with generic universal remotes (unless you buy Logitech Harmony Remotes) TIP:- Prices can easily fluctuate from $79-$99\n",
      "Positive :-> Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.\n",
      "Positive :-> Just what I needed, lightweight and easy to download books from the library\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased 3 of these for Christmas gifts. Our family has several Kindles and they've all been very good tablets! They're great for all ages too.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle Paperwhite is easy to use and great for reading outdoors.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have really enjoyed my Tap. Alexa responds well and I love the charging dock on my desk. The only downside is the app used for setup is not very good.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for music! Speaker quality is excellent! Can listen to Pandora and also through Amazon Prime...Haven't attempted to order from Amazon Prime yet though. It will do other things as well...we are still learning!\n",
      "Positive :-> With knowing not much about Amazon (since I don't use the website much), this is a great first tablet. Easy to use and navigate.\n",
      "Positive :-> Much easier then using phone all the time. Love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it\n",
      "Positive :-> Lots of options and features. Can be used anywhere.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got Alexa for Christmas and love it. Great fun to ask questions but also good for music, listening to books and ordering from amazon. Have not set it up to control anything in the house but am investigating it! Great buy and definitely reccommend!\n",
      "Positive :-> Welcome to our home Alexa! She makes a great addition to our home. I would highly recommend this device.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this Kndle for my daughter who is vision impaired. I was able to increase the size of the print enough that she could read without a magnifying glass. She hadn't been able to read a book for many years so she was thrilled. It's also great that she is able to read with no glare on the screen if she is outside. Great product!\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a great product foe the money. Was able to download games for kids with no problems. Easy to access parental controls for myself..love it\n",
      "Positive :-> Can't recommend the Fire TV enough. This is the best media player on the market, and we've compared it to Roku and Chromecast. We use it more than our Smart TV's apps. Also works pretty well with Playstation Vue if you're using it for TV.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Fire TV box hooks to cable modem easily and is very user-friendly. Great for Amazon Prime members. The only issue is that there is not enough 4K content out there and, in my opinion, does not warrant the price as opposed to the more portable Amazon Fire TV stick. Yes, the box has a faster processor and more RAM than the stick, but for content, I've had NO PROBLEM with the stick and it's cheaper.\n",
      "Positive :-> I personally has Kindle vovage. Paperwhite has flash on every page turn, which is bit not good reading experience\n",
      "Positive :-> The ECHO is really easy to set and use. I am surprised at the quality of sound.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had to buy myself another of these 9W chargers because so many other USB chargers are relatively useless. I have chargers that won't even put out enough power to use the device while it is charging, and in fact, some devices discharge completely if you leave them on while they are charging.The 9W charger does a great job, and eventually, I might have a 9W charger both at my desk and near my bed.I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet cannot be beat for the price we paid. Just wish I would have purchased one that was bigger.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this new Amazon Fire HD. I have a 6 year old and I've set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Amazon Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product. Works as intended. I like the ability for additional memory as well as 4K ability.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation Kindle Paperwhite. The backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker — opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.The one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation Paperwhite is the way it's manufactured — when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. At first I thought this was a manufacturing defect, so I took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except more-visible.This appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. When the Paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of Amazon's e-reader line, and Amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices. Now, that honor falls to the more-expensive Voyage, with the Paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the Kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the Paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the Voyage.This won't be a huge annoyance for some people. It is for me. And it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting Amazon over.For everyone else, though, this is a great e-reader and well worth the money. If you're looking for an e-reader, this is the one to buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> (accidentally posted the wrong review for wrong tablet earlier)This tablet is a steal for the price. I have an old version but bought this one for my sister. You can read books, magazines, stream shows, play games, stream music, and use almost any big named app you can get on google play or apple store. It also gives you a month free of Amazon Prime which gives you so much more to do with this tablet. Honestly considering buying one myself a new one.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love using this as a speaker for my MacBook. I keep it in my office and use it daily!\n",
      "Positive :-> The paperwhite is so cool. I don't know why I didn't get it sooner.\n",
      "Positive :-> My grandson loves his Christmas gift and has not put it down yet. I will buy another for the other grandchildren.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle fire has nice video quality, easily connects to wifi. Now has the ability to use micro sd storage for photos or videos. Micro usb keyboards also work by simply plugging in.\n",
      "Positive :-> The other kids got the kids fire but this is comparable.\n",
      "Positive :-> The kindle fire is such a great tablet with alot of different apps and so easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> overall good but does not find 5ghz networks which is why i returned it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great with the dot across opposite ends of the house.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa on the go. Works as Bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good and easy to handle the price was very good\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a nice tablet for kids and my son enjoys it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for a grandchild. Perfect gift. Recommend this.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is OK for basic weather and turning on/off a light you have linked on your network. She still has some issues understanding basic commands and i would love to see skills from major airlines that allow you to check flights before you drive to the airport. The music sound quality is good and you have to be an Amazon Prime member to really see value there. Hopefully, in a year it will turn out to be a good investment.\n",
      "Positive :-> Overall this unit does everything it is advertised to do. It's hard to review something when it works exactly as described. I've had no issues.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought one for myself several months ago, have enjoyed it so much, I got one for my Mom and one for my Dad as a Christmas gift, they are not tech savvy, but found it easy to use, are enjoying them very much\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa works very well and will connect to many of your automated home systems. There's a great amount of freestanding applications as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> my daughter cant put this thing down, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.\n",
      "Positive :-> Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this tablet will appeal to you! Easy to understand tutorials, smooth animations, and more user friendly than Android or Apple products (and yes I own some of Samsung's and Apple's latest mobile devices) $49 is an amazing price! Best worth per dollar spent!\n",
      "Positive :-> Upgraded my kindle, easy and fast transfer from old to new\n",
      "Positive :-> Fantastic E-Reader. Battery lasts a few weeks on a single charge (if you leave wifi turned off). Feels great in your hands. Is very lightweight.\n",
      "Positive :-> Yeah!!!! I like it... Very convenient to use... The quality was excellent too...\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this after hearing the sound quality of the speakers at my friends house. I also wanted something voice activated in the kitchen to keep handsfree. The sound quality is good. The noise cancelling mics are great at moderate volume. Only downside is no battery operation (it must always be plugged in). Also, even though it has bluetooth and can be paired to a smartphone, you cannot use the echo to pass through phone calls (Only music). For IOT toys its fun for voice control (ex: nest, etc). The skills are mostly cheesy though. Fun toy that allows easy access to prime music, pandora, etc.\n",
      "Neutral :-> It was an okay purchase for my 6 year old. I definitely wouldn't pouches it for myself. Not much you can do on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> My nephew loved the tablet. He's able to download his games and has not experienced any issues as of yet. Fast and efficient, but you will need an Amazon account to run the tablet properly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product..i would recommend.. have no complaints\n",
      "Negative :-> Just got this as a Christmas gift and it doesn't stand.. Nothing to secure it to make it stand.. You can get it to stand maybe to watch a video, but don't touch it. It will fall down easily. Certainly don't stand it and actually use your Fire HD6 with this cover.. You can't.. Falls right over. I feel really badly for the special person that bought me this. Waste of money. I had already bought my own cover, for a lot cheaper, that has more shock protection and that one won't stand on end, but at sits securely at a tilt which makes it more useful for me. The cheaper one I bought on Amazon also has a magnetic closer to the cover stays closed. This one does not. Not sure how to tell the person who bought me this that I don't like this one at all. I'll feel bad telling them, and they'll feel bad hearing it. Bad all around.\n",
      "Positive :-> Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased for one of my granddaughters and she loves it. The price was right and it works great.\n",
      "Positive :-> I liked it as it was a great price and the size was the major factor... Not too big and bulky compared to others.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for running kodi and it does the job much better than the stick. Definitely worth the extra. Much faster and the Alexia on the remote is awesome.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great Christmas gift for a young adult. She loved it\n",
      "Positive :-> It is very easy to read, no glare at all, easy to get up and going.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the Kindle fire over all, but the Kindles definitely have issues with the charging ports. We have the older 7s and we have issues with getting the cords to charge them. As a parent, you are better off not having children plug them in. We still continue to purchase new one because of the reasonable pricing and due to all the amazon app purchases we have made through the years. Hopefully one day they will design a better charging port\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon fire is a perfect size for viewing videos, reading books and playing games. Small enough to fit in a bag or purse.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product. There's always a blue glow in the bedroom.\n",
      "Positive :-> Need to get rid of cable.... one step closer. Great content.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It is a very functional and easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love using this for the house, it works all of my products in the house\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this device to stream Netflix, Amazon Prime, and to play downloaded content. For that purpose it is sufficient. I wouldn't use a Fire Tablet as a productivity device as it is seriously underpowered. Fire tablet bogged down pretty quickly when I attempted to multi-task. Bottomline, this is not an iPad replacement - particularly if you like to do a variety of things on your tablet. But at $33 on sale, this was a very good deal for my purposes.\n",
      "Positive :-> thin and excellent design!most of all, the Amazon fire price was good for thanksgiving gifts.Kids and Youth liked very much!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Amazon Echo for myself right before Christmas. I ended up returning it because my wife got me one as a Christmas present! It's cool technology, and is fun to play around with, but I think the real value of it is realized if you have compatible home automation products. However, I'm not in that boat yet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fire box is the way to go. Speed rules and this is in the top of the class.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this tablet. It is great for indoor reading as well as outdoors. The back lighting makes it ideal for indoor spaces that are not well lit.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this while vacationing in San Diego to be shipped home for me to give as wedding gifts. The store associate at the Best But Mobile Mission Valley was particularly helpful and informative. He saved me from carrying them on flight and had them shipped to my work The new couple loved these tech gifts and emailed me about \"Alexa\" as soon as they opened it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Great tablet for the price!\n",
      "Positive :-> She was happy about it and can't get enough of this tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> Does everything you need the price is as good as can be expected\n",
      "Positive :-> We purchased this Amazon Fire - Kids Edition for my 3 year-old granddaughter. Could not have made a better choice! She was up and running in no time and absolutely loves it.In fact, when my wife (who has an older model Fire tablet) started playing with it, she was so impressed with its capabilities that she now wants one for herself.Very pleased with our purchase!\n",
      "Positive :-> I use it mostly for fun games, although I listen to books on it too.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this new paperwhite after using the regular kindle for a long time. I am amazed by the light weight and the ease of use. The battery makes a huge difference as well. Love it!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Didn't do all that I wanted it to but it is sufficient for my 8 year old son.\n",
      "Positive :-> this is easy to setup even for the wife. 9 year old son is a wiz at this already.\n",
      "Positive :-> it's a great way to receive music and get questions answered\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. My kids and I can't put it down!\n",
      "Negative :-> This thing is a disaster. Unless you are a child or have never used a tablet in your life, you are in for disappointment. They've blocked the Google store, so good luck downloading most of the games you like. Youtube? owned by Google, so again, can't download the app. You CAN get there with the web browser, but why should you have to? I tried to download 3 games-- NONE of which would even load. In short, I owned it less than 16 hours. Waste of my time. Save your money and buy a Samsung Galaxy Tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this for my 5 year old daughter so she could watch cartoons on Netflix. It's very durable, I use it sometimes myself, not a powerful as an iPad mini or galaxy tab but very good for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.\n",
      "Positive :-> My mom asked for this and she loves it, we are looking at the nest next.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a lovely game for kids wolf my daughter have one and I love it\n",
      "Positive :-> I was so pleased with my Fire tablet that I purchased two more for my nieces who are 4 and 2-1/2 years old. Those little fingers love the games and other features and keep the girls busy in their car seats. I love playing games, checking the weather, reading emails, and general surfing on the web with my Fire tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great alternative to an internet connected/gaming tablet for a reading device for kids to use in bed at night.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet for my 5 year old. It is easy to use and i love the Kindle Freetime. Great price. Pretty durable.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works as described. Love the kid friendly foam protector. It stopped working within 2 months of purchase. Amazon just sent new one without a real fuss. Inconvenient, but no real fuss. I hope this one lasts longer.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a full featured tablet at a remarkable price. I have used this tablet on a daily basis and not been disappointed. The only shortcoming I have found is that tablet cases cannot put the tablet to sleep or wake it when the cover is closed or opened. Given the price, however, I really have no problem with that omission.\n",
      "Positive :-> I mainly purchased this tablet for my toddler. I didn't want to spend too much on a tablet since she only likes her one baby app. It works well, good image and sound. Can't beat the price!\n",
      "Positive :-> I GOT MY ECHO AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT, ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE PURCHASED\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for the weekend especially when it rains. Great movie selections\n",

      "Positive :-> Great! Product echo streams my music and tells me the weather love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle gets a lot of use in our house and we've not had a problem with the device after 30 days\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I own one as well and I love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> It gets time to get used to it and sometimes it misunderstands the commands, but overall it is really awesome and a great experience!!\n",
      "Positive :-> It's everything you can ask for in a tablet. The only downfall was the camera, but at a price like that, you get what you pay for.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fire tv is great!!! Easy to use!!!! I love that you can speak to give it commands\n",
      "Positive :-> Great system gives great Television alternatives for people of all kinds\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for everything when your hands are full and if you like to multitask.\n",
      "Positive :-> Its very fast and offers 4k video. Allows you to download 3rd party software to the device. Can't beat it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought one for my mom a few months ago so she could have a bigger screen than her phone . Didn't want to spend too much since they are not big on any kind of electronic. Does the job. Good price for this product. Bought a second one for my dad. Only downfall is I couldn't remove all the pre installed apps on their home screen . Besides that, pretty happy with this tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Amazon Fire HD 8 for my husband for Christmas. He's never too excited about gifts but he is using this tablet every day and even though he won't admit it, he absolutely loves it. Would definitely buy again, especially during Black Friday specials.\n",

      "Positive :-> Gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It was exactly what she wanted.\n",
      "Positive :-> Replaced our old kindle. Still the best for reading outdoors\n",
      "Positive :-> Haven't used product yet. Still reading user guide\n",
      "Positive :-> Happy The Fire TV, Have had no issues, Like another way to use Alexa.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good purchase. If there is a way to make the kindle flash less when navigating, it will be even better\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to use with a particular app but wasn't able to install them so I returned the tablets.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for niece amd nephews. Was easy to set up and they loved it!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought the Fire as a way to have a cheap and easy device for my kid to play on when I want/need the iPad, and as a secondary e-reader. I have Amazon Prime, so adding this device to my account/Amazon ecosystem was incredibly easy. I find the ease of purchasing Amazon items both slick and kind of creepy--but I knew that was part of the deal, buying an Amazon device. I can tune it out when I need to, and parental controls are easy to manage. The device is quick/responsive; color, brightness, and resolution are all quite good for a $50 device. It doesn't do everything but it does a heck of a lot for 50 bucks.\n",
      "Positive :-> Enjoying being able to see the words on the kindle everywhere. Being able to dim is also a wonderfuI feature\n",
      "Positive :-> Took my daughter a little while to get used, now I have to pry it from her hands very pleased this item\n",
      "Positive :-> it is excellent. easy to use. kids use it easily. durable, been dropped a few times and still works\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this TV box does everything and even more. Everyone needs one.\n",
      "Positive :-> I gifted this tablet to my niece and she loves its, easy for her to handle.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good product that has great sound and is fun to have around the house. Wish the product worked more with some of the apps on my phone like Napster.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 3 of these tablets. One for my dad, son and grandson and they all love it! My dad who is 76 years old and not computer lit at all said it is \"pretty easy\" to use (after it was set up by my son for him).\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for my daughter and she loves it great product at a great price!\n",
      "Positive :-> serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter got this for Christmas. Right out of the box it came on, but the screen was all white. Good price, but could never get it to work.\n",
      "Positive :-> I cancelled my satellite service and bought the fire tv after using the firestick, and liking it. It's a great product, and with my amazon prime membership, gives us lots of viewing options, especially for the kids who don't mind not seeing the latest episode of their shows (we also signed up for playstation vue to take the place of our satellite service, which is available on the fire tv). The kids also enjoy all the games on it. The only issue is that many of the games that the kids want to play require a separate controller, which seems to always be out of stock whenever we think about ordering one.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's perfect size to take with you any where. It has great color and the sound can get really loud for it's size. There are a number of games, books, videos, movies and apps that you can get on it.... Some of which are free. You can surf the web and also listen to music on it. My son loves his and my mother-in-law loves hers!\n",
      "Positive :-> Not much to say here. Cheap, fast and very functional. I was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly. Best tablet in its category. If you want something better, you better be ready to pay 3-4 times the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a great purchase! Love the fact I can download TV or movies and watch off-line. Easy set up.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this product, and Alexa has become a good friend. I didn't think I would use this device that much, but I was wrong. From the time I get up for work to the time I turn in for the night, I can always think of something interesting to ask Alexa!\n",
      "Positive :-> I've bought over 10 replacement charging wires, the ones with the micro mail end that inserts into the Fire to charge it. After one or two uses, the wires become loose and fall out. They definitely won't stay put to charge. Does anyone else have this problem? What's the solution? If not for this, I would recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this product for my grandchildren. It is very easy for them to use and sturdy enough not to break when they drop it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use, like lighted screen for reading in dark\n",
      "Positive :-> Simply great. Really comfortable to read, even for hours. Took me a bit to get used to the light settings though, but once I got the hang of it, really nice.\n",
      "Positive :-> bought the fire - 7 tablet for our granddaughter. she loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> Absolutely love this device. Way better than kindle app on iPad or on droid phone.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great charger. Somewhat pricey however. If you attatch it to the cable that comes with the e-book reader, this allows you to plug it into a wall socket.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fast. Almost no buffering. Overall a great product. But only complaint is it's seriously slanted toward Amazon Prime. For instance, I have AMC through a cable subscription. Then why do I need to pay again for episodes on the Amazon AMC app? So stupid. With Roku, I don't need to pay anything extra for episodes I'm already entitled to.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice to review photos on mini sd card but, disappointed that photos can't be downloaded to the hard drive. Better camera with ability to see what you are taking pictures rather than 3rd generation which only has only one camera lens.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet for my wife and she likes it. She plays a few games, checks her email, and goes on Facebook. High end users would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not that great but a good tablet. No problems yet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fire tablet is a cheap one but good enough for my porpose. Actually you get much more than what you pay. Is an excellent retribution for your money.\n",
      "Positive :-> When purchased it wouldnt turn on. After doing some research everyone said theirs did that after dropped or being dropped in water. I FINALLY got it to come on.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activated..so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...\n",
      "Neutral :-> Okay, I think it's okay for a beginner. I would recommend this product too a friend.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great little streaming box. Better than the fire stick.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my eight year old. She absolutely loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> We had gotten some of the other Kindle fire tablets and they were all great to use. This one is no exception.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great way to read books available for downloads from the library\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for my 7 year old she loves it!!! Great price and great product!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Didn't like it. To many pop up ALL THE TIME. Don't recommend at all\n",
      "Positive :-> I've bought 2 of these tablets now for my kids, they're a great value for its low price. Great screen quality, everything you need in a tablet and good size. Very happy with them.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this tablet for my 6 year old grand daughter and I must say it was a great decision. She used her tablet for learning and fun. I watch her play her games on her tablet, listen to her favorite music and watch her movies. She has no problem using her tablet, she has even taught me how to operate her Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> I've never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I'm learning something new about it every day.\n",
      "Positive :-> This came with the Kindle Paperwhite I bought as a birthday present for the love of my life. See that review.\n",
      "Positive :-> It offers many more options than I was looking for. It is easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> my 7\" wore out,my 8\" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional !\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best by far I brought a different kind and had a lot of problems purchased the amazon stick and had no problem streaming movies,shows or playing games\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Echo is a wonderful addition to my house. I can listen to the music i like, when I want to. I am still learning about all of its other wonderful qualities.\n",
      "Positive :-> Christmas present for the spouse which she asked for. Happy wife equals happy life.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best thing that I purchased in a while. I love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great except it offers no mirroring or airplay support\n",
      "Positive :-> I LOVE this kindle!!! The battery life lasts for days.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for a Christmas gift for my daughter. This is the second one I have gotten for her.The first one is starting drop words and she has to download books several times in order to finish reading. She diid a lot of research before she asked for the Paperwhite. I am sure she will love it.o\n",
      "Positive :-> The echo makes life easier and fun. Great speaker!\n",
      "Positive :-> My 3 yr old granddaughter loves this item! PERFECT\n",
      "Positive :-> Compact, Fast, Reliable .... Very GoodI am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love my amazon fire it is very user friendly. I bought one for my parents and used theirs so much I decided to buy one for myself as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was my first time being introduced to the Fire Stick TV and it is awesome with all its features and ability to add multiple applications. 2 thumbs Up!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love using Alexa. She will play music when asked, plays games, answers questions and starts my day with a good morning and ends each evening with a good night!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my daughter and it does everything it needs to and setting up parental controls is quite simple. Great value\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought the Kindle for my daughter. It's the 4th we have bought over the years, one for each child. Great product\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had my Kindle Fire for a couple of weeks and am really enjoying it. I've been impressed with the processor speed and image quality. No problems playing videos or music. The E-reader app is great and has a lot of easy-to-use features. We paired this with Amazon Prime in order to utilize its functions more fully.\n",
      "Positive :-> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO YOU. This product is really light and portable. You can carry it to caf or library for reading. There is no harm to your eyes because of it specific technology. The only drawback is that it will flash when you turn the page. But this is the common problem for this kind of reading stuff. I think it is acceptable. I bought on the price of 99 with a 25 discount. So it really worth it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great keeps a pretty good charge. My sign up for prime to get more bang for my buck but over all solid tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> Good sound, learns more as you use it, can tell reasonably corny jokes, and Amazon come up with a new app almost weekly. Future is great for it. Got it on sale......if I could get that price again, I might get another one.\n",
      "Positive :-> My husband is bed bound and sometimes very weak. The kindle is great for him ,light easy to use and the back light allows him to read in bed without waking me to turn the lights on.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great new tablet as always due to new techknowledgy\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this kindle on the way to the beach. I have an iPad but the glare is so bad. This has been great. I use it all the time outside.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for what it is designed for. Easily modified for Kodi\n",
      "Positive :-> Very limited in capabilities. I am used to using \"OK Google\" on my phone.... Alexa is nowhere near as helpful or intuitive. It's more like Siri Wish it were easier to put iTunes purchases in the Amazon library for Alexa to play. That said, I knew what I was getting. Hoping the technology improved within a couple years.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for kids ... brightness is not so good, .....\n",
      "Positive :-> Ready to buy another pleased with item overall easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> The person I bought this for loves it. She had another tablet that was actually more expensive but she couldn't load apps or anything to.\n",
      "Positive :-> Don't know much about this item. I purchased it on Black Friday for my niece. Hope she likes it.\n",
      "Positive :-> The box does exactly what it saids it will do. No lag, great quality, very happy!!!\n"

      "Positive :-> Great device, I did exchange it for a white one. It would work better if I had better internet connection at my house.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great as a e reader as well as a tablet. My son loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two of these, one for each of my granddaughters. They absolutely love them.\n",
      "Positive :-> great for teen agers and easy to use and set up small enough to take as you travel lots off apps to choose from long battery life as well would buy again and would reckomend this to every one even at a great price as well\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for my needs. Really enjoy it, easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> We now own 4 Echos. We have them in our bedrooms and living area. It really is an amazing device. We use it to turn many of our lights on and off, control our outside sprinkler system, wakes us up with alarms, listen to all kinds of music and other information. I also use it to monitor my Amazon purchases and buy things on Amazon that we have purchased before. I understand there now are over 1000 functions it can perform depending on what you desire. Once you get one you will wonder how you lived without it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best device for streaming very fast....\n",
      "Positive :-> ideal for reading books just like a hard cover book\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product for the price. Would recommend to anyone.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was the first tablet we purchased for our kids and love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> You can use this for reading, surfing the net, taking pictures. The best deal and product you can get for near nothing. I bought 10 and have them to my now best friends.\n",
      "Positive :-> Far exceeded my expectations. Very simple setup. Having Amazon Prime makes this purchase a \"no brainer\"\n",
      "Positive :-> I was not expecting much and was a little afraid to purchase the fire tablet. I was quite surprised by the build quality and am extremely surprised by the performance. I am thinking of buying more for the family.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the product itself but its app is very slow esp. outside the U.S. when you are on the go.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have enjoyed my Amazon Fire. It tends to be slow to download but other than that I am very happy with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> We wanted an additional easily portable tablet for our family. The omnipresent advertising is annoying but also easy to just ignore. For 50 bucks, this is a great way to have an additional e-reader/browser/streaming and gaming device.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really love both Amazon tv and Apple TV as products. I do wish Amazon tv has a simplified AirPlay ability for iOS. I'm sure with apps you buy and other methods you can accomplish it but if it was just standard like Apple TV AirPlay I would give this product 5 stars. For cheap easy price it makes a great gift. Where it beats Apple TV is 4 k streaming. So if you want 4K get Amazon Fire tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> FireTV box is a lot better than the FireStick...Awesome device, just had an issue with one firestick freezing up a lot but was easily returned when i brought it back to the store. no verification was needed and they exchanged it for a new one. I use them to have Kodi on them and i have a total of 4 in different rooms. They do freeze up sometimes when running a big build or a big app on them which gets annoying... then i use the FireTV which is better and can handle more than the stick can.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is one of the best tabs for kids to start with.Rugged and sophisticated.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great streaming box to watch anything from the internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is revolutionary. She does so many things. No reason to be jealous. Bring her home,invite her in!\n",
      "Positive :-> We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends\n",
      "Positive :-> Home automation is right around the corner with the Amazon Echo. Great companion....period.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have eBook readers on my iPad, but my Kindle is much more enjoyable to use for reading books. It's lighter weight and non glare screen make a big difference.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this so i can save all of my books. It was a bit small at first but you get used to it. Overall i am very satistfy\n",
      "Positive :-> I gave this item to my wife and she loves it. She has used it to answer many questions and listen to music.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a bday gift and I absolutely love it! She tells jokes, plays music and much much more! Fun for the entire family or just some relaxing down time!\n",
      "Positive :-> My first kindle. Really like it. Glad I bought it!\n",
      "Positive :-> it works very well for a small black box on my concil.\n",
      "Positive :-> Loved my Kindle so much I bought one for my wife too. She loves the Kindle and find we both devote more time to reading!\n",
      "Positive :-> As expected, light and easy to carry around. Also easy to order books with an Amazon account\n",
      "Positive :-> a very easy unit to use. Lots of entertainment options to watch.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really enjoyed this purchase,will by this product again\n",
      "Positive :-> This replaced my dish/cable. Soooo many apps to choose from. Speaking into the remote is a HUGE plus. Ease of use is 2nd to none. I also bought a fruit TV, and this is hands down better.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet I purchased 4 for my nephews!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I was able to catch this thing on sale Black Friday for $70. It could possible be the best $70 I have ever spent. Everyone should own a amazon fire tv!\n",
      "Positive :-> It's as near as the public can enjoy towards artificial intelligence.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very satisfied with the Kindle Paperwhite reader. The single issue I have is that I would like to have the capability to do reverse contrast. Not a deal breaker for me thought.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter love it so much and she love caring it around with her\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product! Just as I expected!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my grandson who loves it. Easy to understand and lots of great apps to download. Forget the iPad - buy this instead and get the same functionality for way less money\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good tablet. Kids are happy and so am I. Got my stuff back now that kids have their own.\n",
      "Positive :-> Upgraded from a6\" inch Fire HD. For 89.00 I don't think you can find a better tablet value. Resolution is very sharp, audio is good, and it is a good size.\n",
      "Positive :-> Had a Fire 7 previously which was ok but this one is brighter, faster and the larger keyboard makes a huge difference.\n",
      "Positive :-> bought for my wife for her birthday and she loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> I had it for two months and I start loving to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this as a gift. My mom is really enjoying it. It works great!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this because of the low price on Black Friday. My aging eyesight was making it difficult to read my original Kindle. And, I have gotten spoiled by my other products with touch screen. Thrilled I bought this because can see to read at night again and touch screen is nice. The light is not too bright, so does not cause headaches for me.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fire TV has all the apps I need to use. It has games and movies you can watch on it. The remote has a microphone command to find things on the TV.\n",
      "Positive :-> Use is all the time. Backyard favorite. Great by the fire.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for my son! He has fine motor deficits and the games definitely help him work on using one finger at a time to play them! I also don't have to worry about him getting onto anything that isn't kid friendly since he doesn't know my passcode for the adult profile!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I \"upgraded\" from my Kindle Fire to the Paperwhite! I couldn't be happier with my decision.\n",
      "Positive :-> I saved $85 per month on my cable bill using the Amazon fire TV. And even though I signed up for Amazon prime, Netflix, and sling TV, I still saved $40 per month and have 10 times as much content and choices. I love it! ( I also recommend using Plex media server to stream all your content directly from your computers to your big screen TV. It's free! )\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire TV helped my LED flat screen tv become a smart tv to watch Hulu, Netflix, and listen to music.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this on sale for my son. He and I use the tablet to watch movies, play games, read books, and browse the Internet. It's great for the price we paid. If you're a fan of Amazon, you automatically have apps for their services.The downside is you are not able to use google apps and the adds that appear from Amazon when you turn the device on.\n",
      "Positive :-> So I decided to pull the trigger into buying the FireTV, I've use the first version and liked it ok, I've also use the FireStick and don't think it's fast enough. You can get a lot of apps with this box and find it a bit faster than the first version. Pretty good buy in my opinion.\n",
      "Positive :-> doesnt do me any good without a cord to go with it\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for a gift and the receiver loves it. It's so easy to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> Couldn't go without it. Old one conked out on vacation and this was great. Sister has one too.\n",
      "Positive :-> works out of the box, no problems with setup. connects to all the popular streaming apps like hulu amazon prime netflix\n",
      "Positive :-> She loves it. It works really well and its features are amazing\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Echo is great. It was easy to set up. Alexis tells me the weather, plays anything I ask her and adjusts the volume at my request! Amazing.\n",
      "Neutral :-> edge could be wider to make it easier to hold. other then that a very good product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Third Kinlde and my favorite as I can easily read in sunny conditions. Light weight, more compacy and battery life seems excellent.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's more for fun, We use it for shopping lists and music mostly. Would love to get my whole house on for lighting.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as my nephews first tablet. He loves it, and it's still in one piece! Worth my $!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love reading so this e-reader works really well for me. I just wish it was a little bigger. I was used to another e-reader that had a larger screen. Otherwise, it works!\n",
      "Positive :-> I picked up three of these during the holiday sales as gifts for family members. We have many Kindles that we use daily the last few years and been satisfied will all of them and Amazon offers all the content you could need for a base tablet. Great for adults or the kids (with a proper protective case). Books, video, music, and games...performs well on all. The only con I can think of is Amazon is a little weak in the app variety department, nowhere near the offering of iTunes but for the price and performance, this tablet can't be beat.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second Kindle Paperwhite. My first Kindle died (I believe it was old age as cause of death) and the next day I went out and purchased a replacement. So easy to set up and there were all my books. The Paperwhite is so easy on your eyes and love that you can adjust the font to any size that's comfortable. Can be used with dim lighting or no lighting at all. Great for reading in bed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy fast and portable great fun for everyone!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the Echo as a Deal of the Day for $130. At this price it is worth it. I have learned only simple things so far (Prime Music, weather, daily Jeopardy questions and getting it to tell jokes). But, I think it is well made and I'm sure I'll learn how to use it for more things.\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet was everything I expected and some. Great product for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a nice little unit! Very portable and easy to read, or watch movies except in bright sunlight, it is easy to change the tablet light to not bother others in low light conditions\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle is amazing. This is my second one. The price was misleading however as I had to pay something like another extra 30 bucks to get rid of the ads. Just know that\n",
      "Positive :-> Great the product is upto the mark kids will love it\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been enjoying my echo for about a month. I enjoy using it for Pandora, flash update, and general things like weather, and information through Wikipedia. There is room for improvement in services, but that is being addressed with new skills being added. Generally, I like it.\n",
      "Positive :-> We were so excited to get the tap since it was a larger speaker than the dot and unlike the echo has a battery charger with it to make it portable. We already have an echo which works perfectly in our home. When listening to online radio on the tap it cut in and out constantly. We returned it and exchanged gor the dot.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the Amazon Echo! Easy setup and receives voice commands well. Music is crisp and verbal information is very understandable.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this to replace my old 3G Kindle with Keyboard and it is great that I don't have to use a outside light to read after dark. Good job Amazon!\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is excellent with apps available for many strraming services and capable of third party app implementations as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had originally bought my son the Kindle Fire HDX. And it worked great for him. The only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted. All the features are the same. It is a great buy. I would highly recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> setup and ran this box within 10 minutes, very portable, and works just great\n",
      "Positive :-> I was amazed how little it cost to get a Kindle Fire these days. I passed down my iPad mini to my son because he uses it a lot and I just wanted something to watch Netflix and read books. The big plus is the book lending library with our prime membership. It's noticibly slower than my old iPad, but for $50 I'm very happy with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> got as a replacement for young child. worked well for him.\n",
      "Positive :-> Was a great Black Friday find I enjoy playing on it . It's easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> Quick with fun facts. Great for playing various genres of music rather than searching for radio stations.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought two as gift to kids. They love it very much\n",
      "Positive :-> Had the Fire Stick before this and liked it, but felt load times were a little slow due to less ram and a worse processor. This FireTV is excellent! Load times are extraordinarily and it is lightning fast. Would recommend this to everyone.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product! It is SO much easier to read when it's sunny outside!\n",
      "Positive :-> I find this product to be great on plane rides due to extended battery life and great section of reading material\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for the wife for x-mass does a lot of cool stuff she love it does every thing she wants and more\n",
      "Positive :-> This Kindle works great for reading outdoors in daylight and can also download books using the Wi-Fi from the device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up\n",
      "Positive :-> Had a kids fire and switched to this with a kids case and tempered glass this time works really well for kids\n",
      "Positive :-> I love Alexa so much, it makes my life easier. Perfect device if you're planning to automate your house. The price is reasonable and affordable to every class.\n",
      "Positive :-> Paperwhite feature is perfect for intended uses. Outside, on the beach, at night.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the functionality of the Echo and how easy it is to use. The major downfall for me is not being able to synchronize with Apple calendar as it only allows for Google calendars to sync. I also like that I can tell Alexa to add things to my shopping list or play different kind of music. Overall is a God purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best tablet and most affortable. Love that it just works. Must have Prime.\n",
      "Positive :-> Wife's favorite of all the Kindles. She sold her Fire.\n",
      "Positive :-> This item is perfect for my son. Now he has his own game system no more low battery for my phone. Price is the best part you can't go wrong with this choice . I am very satisfied .\n",
      "Positive :-> This box will replace cable, food and water. If it didn’t need power, I’d live for free!\n",
      "Positive :-> purchased as a gift for my 8 year old niece she absolutely loves it and it is easy for her to use. Mom loves the parental settings on it as well!\n",
      "Positive :-> I enjoy Alexa. It is very helpful. The news flash briefing is my favorite. I love that the device continues to learn.\n",
      "Positive :-> My only complaint is that 8GB is really not enough memory if you do audiobooks or videos.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon likes to push their content and this tablet shows that. A good amount of ads distract users at time. But overall a good tablet for a child to get entertained with.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazing price in black fire use it with an iPad to watch Amazon prime\n",
      "Neutral :-> Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!\n",
      "Positive :-> Installed the Kodi program on this & it works better then Netflix - I get to watch the latest shows for FREE.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a wonderful little tablet. Was going to shop around. Saw it first, thought I'd try it. Haven't used the cameras yet. I love the size. It's just what I need. I browse the internet. Shop &play games. Also watch TV programs &much more.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love its portability! The speakers are phenomenal!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device for reading indoors or outdoors. Very easy to navigate.\n",
      "Positive :-> Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad!\n",
      "Positive :-> Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fine quality. I love the options available with the Amazon Fire tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet works just like expected. Great for the games I like to play. It is just the right size to carry in my purse. No problems.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it so far, no problems, easy setup and lots of skills to add on. Plan on using it extensively with home automation.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for your kids at 50.00 bucks wont hurt that much when your kids accidentally break it or damage it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fast and easy to use. Kid friendly :) Simple to navigate, clear and clean picture.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet all around. Good for kids for the parental control options.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this to use with my SmartThings home automation system. Use voice commands from the Echo to trigger automation. Much more convenient than getting your phone out and loading the SmartThings app. Sometimes it has a hard time understanding what I say.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this tablet. It is a perfect size, works great and was very affordable.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 2 year old granddaughter carries her tablet everywhere. She loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> It would be better if it had a better camera. Its still a great tablet!\n",
      "Positive :-> This new kindle is so much easier to read than my second generation kindle that I had for years. It is faster, and the back-light can be adjusted easily to get the right amount of light for your reading pleasure. If you love books, you should get this.\n",
      "Positive :-> maybe i got a dud, but from every forum i read it seemed the fire tv box was 10x better then the stick. although it is faster, i still have a lagging experience with this streaming device\n",
      "Positive :-> I got it for my nephew and he very loves it.Great\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product! Love BB Great product! Love BB Great product! Love BB\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up. Fun to use. Working toward whole house automation.\n",
      "Positive :-> You can't beat the price...Picked this one up for only $60 from Best Buy..I like the additional control parents have with kindles. It's great when you want to limit your kid's time on youtube, games etc. I would certainly recommend this to a friend..\n",
      "Positive :-> I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can't order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it's very well build .\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this item not to play games, but to use as a search tools and read newspapers and books . Works perfectly. Great Price for Xams.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for a 5 year old and a 1 year old for they birthday. They love to play on it!\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a excellent gift for someone who likes to read alot.\n",
      "Positive :-> fire TV has everything anyone would need for their digital entertainment. It's easy to set up and easy-to-use\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet based on price and the reviews for tablets in this price range. It has performed well for my child. I especially love the parental controls that are easy to setup and the ability to have multiple profiles on 1 device. I'm now thinking of buying one for myself to replace a stolen iPad.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's just what I was looking for, something simple and inexpensive. Plus I got it for $35 on black friday.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is by far the best streaming device around. My Chromecast was just given to someone free of charge. That was a waste of money. There isn't much you cant do with this. Couple this with a Prime membership and by by cable.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have cut my cable. I would have done this before but didn't know how to get college sports. Fire with Amazon and SlingTV has bridged the gap. I receive local channels with an antennae and the fire does the rest. Saving about $75 per month.\n",
      "Positive :-> We are having so much fun with the Echo. Alexa plays our favorite music we've saved in our libraryfinds new songs, gives us news updates and weather reports. I know she does much more but we have not had the time to experiment..The sound quality is great. After we bought ours, I bought a second one for a Christmas Gift.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kids love it! We are Prime members, good kid friendly case... purchased a 128gb memory card to hold all kinds of games and movies\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good value. Perfect for checking emails, watching videos and browsing the Internet . Only disappointment is the camera is not great quality but ok\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to use and worth every penny! I would recommend this to anyone who needed smart tv capabilities.\n",
      "Positive :-> A very good product by amazon. Considering the price, even better.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a very good tablet for kids to use. You can set up time them to play game and time to read!\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a great tablet for the price. I bought it as a gift and they loved it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best tablet hands down for kids! Great parental controls and content selection is awesome with Amazon Freetime!\n",
      "Negative :-> I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.\n",
      "Positive :-> I only use Amazon products for streaming and I always recommend them to my friends & acquaintances as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am a long time Kindle user. I also have a Kindle Fire 8. I keep buying the newer versions because I like the product very much.\n",
      "Positive :-> The is a comfortable device. It's easy to hold even with a cover. No eye strain. The light doesn't disturb anyone else, but makes it possible to read in a dark space. The battery lasts a long time. I like this much better than my nook.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have owned three versions of the amazon echo: the original, the dot, and the tap. This is the most versatile of the three. The wireless recharging is great. The sound is not as good as the original, but the portability makes up for this. At $79 it was a fantastic buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa definitely makes life easier. The only downside is that she doesn't understand everything you say. I mostly use her for music, timers, and daily weather and news. The DOT doesn't have the sound quality of the full Echo, though\n",
      "Positive :-> So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.\n",
      "Positive :-> Old charger was taking forever to charge the device so I went in to Best Buy and found this comparable charger and it works great!\n",
      "Positive :-> Too much configuration in order to work as needed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this primarily to side load Kodi on it for viewing on my new 4k Samsung. Makes an excellent platform for what I use it for. Also enjoy the voice activation of music depending on what I'm in the mood for. No more Pandora!\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product for the money. Compared to earlier versions not as durable. The outside casing is plastic. Not good. For the money good buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have this tablet and loved it so much I gave one as a gift. Battery life is long.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great display and colors easy to use. Very good entry level tab great price seems to be very durable great apps. Would recommend to anyone wanting entry level tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great service I loved all of the items and were great gifts\n",
      "Positive :-> Our tablet is fast and works very well. I am pleased with the amount of apps that Amazon offers.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fire TV is where it's at in today's world! This little media streaming device fits in the palm of my hand but doesn't lack in the content available to my entertainment needs! No matter which one you subscribe to it's totally worth it! I'm actually thinking about cutting the cord on my cable? I couldn't be happier with this amazing little box!\n",
      "Positive :-> A great little tablet built for kids with access to volumes of free apps for a year, including books, games, etc. It can be easily used by kids of almost any age.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great item ! Bought one for my 20 yr old as a Christmas gift . Ended up going back and getting one for my 11 yr old and myself as well. I am not good with electronics & this is easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet works well for a kid, easy for our almost 4 year old to navigate between activities. Hard to beat with the case and 2 year warranty.\n",
      "Positive :-> The perfect e-reader quite simply. Does exactly what you need it to do.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up. East tie you. Would highly recommend this product to others\n",
      "Positive :-> The kids absolutely love this tablet! Grabbed it while it was on clearance and ordered kid proof cases with them also! It's been great for road trips and all!\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle Paper White is the perfect gift for anyone. My mom had the original Kindle and it recently broke. When I was looking for a new one for her I looked at other Kindles and e-book readers. I wasn't a fan of the Nook and the Kindle Fire is great, but she wanted something simple just to read so she didn't need the internet connection. After playing with the Paper White in the store I decided it was perfect for her. She is not the best with technology, but after I showed her how to use it once she was able to use it on her own. Great gift for anyone!\n",
      "Positive :-> Decided to go with this along with playstation vue and a couple other subscriptions I already had to cut the cord from cable. This little box is excellent for all sorts of streaming. Shows come in very clear. The response time is great. Only down side is bluetooth and not IR but a nice $20 adapter and boom now my universal remote works with this. Definitely would recommend for anyone looking to cut ties with their cable company.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am not a savvy table user. I actually don't like tablets to start with. I prefer my convertible Windows 10 laptop but there is a Bible app called youversion that is very useful to me and my iPhone screen is too small and my laptop is too big to carry to Church so this tablet is perfect for me. Coupled with a leather case it is easier to hold and enjoyable to use. I got it on sale from Best Buy for $33 + tax. It is a great deal at this incredible price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Much lighter than my old kindle. Love it, love the fact that it has the camera too\n",
      "Positive :-> We already had one Amazon fire tablet and liked it so much that we decided to purchase another for the grandkids to use when they come over.\n",
      "Positive :-> My grand daughter loves it, hasn't put it down since we bought it from her. Clear picture, runs great, she loves to watch videos and play music.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not the paperwhite, but for the price I paid works great for my kids to carry around multiple books they need to read for school\n",
      "Negative :-> It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an excellent tablet for reading and playing games.\n",
      "Positive :-> Set up was automatic. I really didn't need to know anything specific. Just follow the prompts. Really great for my kids.\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet bought for a 10 year old child. Perfect pricing for a lot of tablet. Great pricing and good product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for Christmas gifts for a few people and each say they love this tablet . For the price it's great .\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it, love it, love it. I was able to also sync my Sirrius Satelite service to it too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product the kids love it. We use it for music and news. Kids love to ask it to tell them jokes\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as an adjunct to an older Kindle and so that I can also access four email accounts easily from one place while traveling. Screen is bright and makes reading easy. Item is small enough to get into my carry-on bag and I can pull it out and read emails from my personal accounts and my business accounts. I have also purchased the extra memory to download more movies.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is the coolest thing! I love it. I even got one for my son, and he listens to music as he falls asleep at night. It's awesome. Buy one!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is embarrassing. I purchased one game from amazon app store. The app crashed right away after I started it. I don't know how Amazon tested all these apps on their own device. But the experience is really bad.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great in helping me stay organized; it's instant entertainment, it's instant information, and it aides in securing my home. Awesome is an understatement!\n",
      "Positive :-> This product was a replacement for the one my husband had which was an older generation. He loves the paperwhite, much easier to read in daylight, he does take it to work with him. He says it is overall better in many ways.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fun to use but not fun with the software. I tried forever to get it to recognize my light modules to turn the lamps on and off. I gave up. If they ever fix the software it would be great. Other than that, it is nice to ask Alexa things and play music. Speaker is good. Amazon Echo software needs a lot of improvement.\n",
      "Positive :-> This item was very easy to use from the very beginning and was very responsive to my request and commands. I like the fact that you can also add other items to work with it\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet because of the excellent apps it offers and it's easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> This has gotten such rave reviews from the recipient of this Christmas gift that I will be getting one for myself now.\n",
      "Positive :-> Today's technology allows hands free multitasking. I would highly recommend..\n",
      "Positive :-> It has some cool uses when it comes to books, music and home controls. However it needs better capability for voice control and command.\n",
      "Positive :-> For wife, she likes it. Good to read and play games on\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased for my 2year old. So I could keep her off my phone.But I use it also. It is our first tablet it is user friendly for both myself and 2year old.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a great tablet for a child and even adults.\n",
      "Positive :-> Everyone of my siblings & my parents have 1 & we all love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Echo, \"Alexa\" is great! The Echo has a fantastic speaker so when you want to hear some 80s hits or modern jazz or relaxing background music, just ask! It is really helpful for those little trivia bits of info you wonder about when you're watching TV and usually look up on your phone, then end up checking your email, Facebook, etc and miss half of the show. We have HUE lights in 3 rooms of our house which operate with a phone app. They are great (I definitely recommend them also), but it is wonderful to be able to ASK to have the lights turned on when you need to go to the kitchen in the dark or when your hands are full...or at night when you need all the lights off. It's very user friendly, just one app and about 2 minutes sets the whole thing up. I gave it to my husband for Christmas. It's the best gift ever!\n",
      "Positive :-> Better than I thought easy to set up small enough where it dosent take up much room and sound is good\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a cheaper alternative for using with kids. Battery lasts longer than most tablets, the reason why I gave this such a mediocre rating is because you can't put a wallpaper for the lock screen. You always have an ad for something Amazon related, which can be annoying. But if it's just something small for the kiddos to use, good choice. I wouldn't recommend for adults.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great entertainment. possibilities endless.I love it\n",
      "Positive :-> It was the perfect Christmas present. Made everyone smile\n",
      "Positive :-> Kids love it to death! Games and tv also learning its wonderful\n",
      "Positive :-> Good deal, better than purchasing from Amazon, from BB, you get the points, but get nothing from Amazon.\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet is Worth for the Price. It is really fast in response.\n",
      "Positive :-> I still haven't been able to figures out my kindle, it seems like it has very cool features but learning slowly how to take take full advantage of it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 3 year old grand child is loving this tablet. She is really catching on to using technology . She loves this and plays a lot of educational things that was available to her.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my in-laws who are not tech-savvy and they are truely enjoying the ease of use.\n",
      "Positive :-> So much better than reading on an iPad, completely worth it. I guess my only complaint is the operating system still seems a little weak in terms of responsiveness and fluidity but doesn't really impact regular usage of just page turning, only felt while browsing the library/store etc.\n",
      "Neutral :-> I bought this charger Nov 28 2015. It's now Jan 1 2016 (a little over a month later) and the device doesn't charge my kindle any longer. I have the kindle shutdown and allow it to be plugged in for multiple hours. After I take the charger off and start to use my Kindle within 30 minutes I see the Low Battery message. If I use the charger that came with my Kindle for the same amount of time I don't see the Low Battery message as quickly as I did with this charger. Not sure what's going on but makes me think I have a faulty device -- costs a lot of money for something that doesn't work any longer than 1 month\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the echo. Great for listening to music and quick information\n",
      "Positive :-> I like it very much good product . I used every day\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this kindle for a friend and they absolutely enjoy it.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Slow with limited application. Battery doesn't last long and the download speed is less than expected.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this tablet because I could control my children his time with it it's working out really great\n",
      "Positive :-> Simply the best the fire stick is also a great deal but for flawless connectivity fire tv is worth the extra green backs.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use it mainly for sling but I do so much more with it and I love the remote that I can speak to Alexa\n",
      "Positive :-> Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that.\n",
      "Positive :-> easy to use, easy to love. extremely user friendly. Beats the nook I had by a 1000%. the battery life is outstanding\n",

      "Positive :-> Purchased as Christmas gift for grandchild who loves both music and gadgets\n",
      "Positive :-> It was a Christmas gift, not a big reaction at the time. He has very poor vision so I thought it would be a good gift. I think he is starting to like it as he uses it more and learns what he can do with it.\n",

      "Positive :-> This is actually a gift I bought my sister for her big ?? Birthday! I received my echo as a birthday gift from a friend and let me tell you... I LOVE IT!!!It is so sleek and loud and crystal clear! I love waking up and asking Alexa to tell me the weather forecast and news updates. The music sounds awesome too! But let me tell you the \"magic\" of this echo... I had to go to Italy for a family thing and my hubby couldn't take the time off of work so I went without him (sad face)The best way for me to show him how much I missed him was to wake him up with our favorite song! That's right folks I would wake my husband up from 1000's of miles away with a touch of a button on my cell phone!!He sent me a text \"is that you?\" Wow!!! I couldn't believe it.So enough said just go out and buy one!!\n",

      "Positive :-> The Amazon Fire met all my expectations. I would highly recommend this unit over the Roku 3. It is easy to install. Of course, Amazon has terrific online / phone support. The Fire has a competitive price point. The Remote is much more intuitive and easy to use versus the Roku 3. There are many more apps and \"How-to's\" on YouTube. My unit is more versatile than the Roku 3. Plus the Amazon \"behemoth\" is committed to making the Fire the best video/music streamer at a reasonable cost with many app options. Amazon is not going away soon! However, be careful, this unit can be very additive.\n",

      "Positive :-> Works very well! Love my kindle!\n",
      "Positive :-> We love it no need for cable! Just make sure you have really good internet!\n",
      "Positive :-> The first thought came into my mind after getting Kindle Paperwhite that why I didn't buy this thing earlier! It is an awesome device. I really didn't think that a digital device can fill up the space of a physical book. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good tablet for a beginner. Very easy to use. However wished the color on the screen was better.\n",
      "Positive :-> As a full time student, I wanted a budget tablet that would let me read pdf files, open class notes and powerpoint presentations. I got the fire 7 when it was on sale for 39.99. It does what I wanted and more. I use it for class and to kill time between classes with games, movies, and youtube. Battery will last two days of constant use, the size is perfect and fits my pant pocket (back). Overall great buy. Only downfall is the volume to my headphones, I found it to be quite low, but for the price, good enough.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my third. I buy them for all my grandkids.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased for 6 year old. Love free time. Parental controls are great. Can set to read books before playing games. Also can set time limits\n",
      "Positive :-> It's great for my kids or anyone! The display is really nice\n",
      "Positive :-> I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product easy to use and scroll, better than a competitor product we purchased\n",
      "Positive :-> Did what its suppose to do my kid loves it. Amazon keep up the great work\n",

      "Positive :-> Great tablet for the price, it was a Christmas present and so far so good!\n",
      "Positive :-> I originally bought the more expensive, Voyage model, and I definalty prefer this one. It is much easier to grip, and is doesn't get as smudgy. I could not tell much difference in the screen quality, the major noticeable thing was the Voyage has a smooth screen, and this one is a little rough to the touch, but that doesn't matter at all.\n",
      "Positive :-> this is a great product with several streaming options.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use this tablet to control music on my surround sound home speaker system. It works great for that purpose. Streams directly to the receiver with no lag, and fits perfectly on the wall. Great device for this purpose\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this .. Great extra for my amazon echo .. Does everything it does but it's cordless .. Keeps charge for many days .. Push button to activate .. Wireless speaker also out of wifi .. Really cool !!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is very easy to use and lightweight. Very convenient\n",
      "Positive :-> Excited about this product, it is going to be fun to use and an interesting addition!\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great! Still trying to figure it all out but I have no problems so far. I am looking forward to expanding my uses for it but so far it makes for a great speaker!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Fire reader! The best feature is being able to change the screen to black with white letters. This is much easier on my sensitive eyes.\n",

      "Positive :-> This was purchased for my Kindle and I like it! Makes it easy to recharge it wherever I am. Recommend this product!\n",
      "Positive :-> Could not be happier with this purchase. The voice activated command button on the remote works fantastic. If you do not have a smart TV, highly recommend this device. It buffers for maybe 5 seconds to start a show and then displays perfectly.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great gift for anyone that loves technology. Great to listen to music, news, radio or for reference.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a very good product and excited to use it.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kid enjoys watching his cartoons on the fire tv\n",
      "Positive :-> Just as great as expected and all reviews say with simple answer easy setup\n",
      "Positive :-> Upgraded my FireStickTV to the Fire TV box. Much happier with the direct connect versus Wi-Fi.\n",
      "Positive :-> When I first grabbed an echo I thought it would be kinda gimmicky, but I loved it so much I bought two more echos and several dots. I have Alexa all over the house. The smart home integration is so wonderful. I feel like I am living in Star Trek when Alexa turns my lights on and off and does other tasks.\n",
      "Positive :-> does not understand me about half the time. would like to program it to fit my needs more. Great for timing eggs\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Amazon Fire as a gift and it works great. If you want a tablet that is not expensive and will work for games this would be a great choice.\n",
      "Positive :-> I started with the original kindle- loved it but light was bright on the cover for night reading. Then got the fire as a gift and love that but reads more like on a tablet.. Broke down and bought the latest paperweight to read at night- great light to dim for night reading. Very light too!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased one for our son and liked it so much that we bought one for ourselves. It is very helpful in the kitchen for conversions, timers, and music. My favorite is checking my commute before I leave in the morning. The only downside is I had to do a lot of research on the capabilities, there was no one stop shop. Learning new things and like all gadgets, it is not necessary but fun to have.\n",
      "Positive :-> Worth every penny, if you set it up correctly.....\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter uses hers for college books. Best gift\n",

      "Positive :-> This is a great product for watching movies especially if you're tired of paying those high cable prices.\n",
      "Positive :-> Compared to the initial kindle this is a big impovement. Great for the Black friday promotional price.\n",
      "Positive :-> El libro electrnico es muy prctico, puedes tener todos los libros ah.\n",
      "Positive :-> I never had a legitimate reason for owning a tablet. I prefer watching shows and movies on my TV and I prefer reading actual books as opposed to a tablet. However, when I learned that Best Buy was selling this Amazon tablet for $34.99 on Black Friday, I knew that I had to get my hands on one. Even with the aforementioned reasons for not getting one, I couldn't argue with that price. I think it's a great starter tablet. It may not have the largest screen or HD quality but then again I don't need all of that. The quality and size of the screen are perfect for that price. 8GB may not be a lot of memory but there is also an option to get more storage via a memory card. I very much satisfied and recommend this tablet to anybody, especially those who are curious about tablets and haven't purchased on yet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the Amazon Echo. Can use it for a lot of stuff. Love it.\n",

      "Positive :-> Excellent for reading and has lots of other uses with wifi\n",
      "Positive :-> I prefer this than the fire stick because it doesn't freeze like the stick does.\n",
      "Positive :-> Just love my new tablet. I have had a kindle fire for 4 years and it was messing up badly so I needed a new one badly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Paperwhite Kindle is awesome. Lightweight and easy to use. I can dim the backlight so that I don't disturb my husband when I read in bed at night.\n",
      "Positive :-> Just looking for an affordable tablet and found this one...very pleased!\n",
      "Positive :-> i brought this to my daugther and she loves it, she can go on netflix, amazon music and youtube easily, good display pretty good volume\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that\n",
      "Positive :-> We are having a blast with Alexa, eventually we will grow our Alexa's family...i.e.: lights, tv... we are becoming so lazy... wish she would clean the house too... :)))\n",
      "Positive :-> This device is simple to use and works great! Highly recommended!\n",
      "Positive :-> i really like this product bought it as a gift for kids\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this so that I could use Skype to check on my dogs during the day. I had to download an app that makes the Fire stay on otherwise it goes to sleep. Once I had that app installed and Skype doing the Auto-Answer it worked well. Overall if I was going to use this as a reader or mini tablet it looks like a good product. The screen is bright and sharp.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the Amazon Alexa products! I have 1 Show, 1 Echo, 2 dots, and the Tap. Wish the Tap had the drop-in feature. The tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say \"Alexa\" instead of the blue lights on the other products. Great for taking outside!\n",
      "Negative :-> Pretty tangerine color. First tablet had bad earphone jack; Second product would not connect to wifi no matter where we tried. All of our other tablets work fine.We will order another Amazon fire tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is one for the living room. And my other one Is for travel one.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my new Amazon Fire tablet. Its so easy to use and stays charged for a nice amount of time.\n",
      "Positive :-> I gave as a gift to a kid who has autism! It has been helping on his development a lot!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing.\n",
      "Positive :-> I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use. Comfortable to hold-lightweight and good size. The light adjustment is great. Easy to inadvertently turn the page-sometimes more than one-still trying to figure out how not to do that. Over all, though very happy with it\n",
      "Positive :-> ITS PERFECT. I LOVE MY ALEXA. DOES EVERYTHING I WANT IT TO DO\n",
      "Positive :-> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 4YR OLD. WE HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET AS IT IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. FROM WHAT I READ THIS WILL DO THE JOB FOR HIM. THE PRICE AND COLOR WAS GREAT.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this as a christmas gift for nephew, he loves his tablet. His mom loves it even more now that he can play some games on it. Tablet is not too heavy, just put a protective case to protect your investment.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this, so I could reduce my cable bill and I have to say, that I'm completely satisfied with Fire TV and the service I received from Best Buy, thank you!\n",
      "Positive :-> Good price while on sale. Also reward is the reason I go there\n",
      "Positive :-> I use the email, search, and read books primarily. My fingertips are still clumsy on the keyboard but will improve! I forget how to access some things but ask those who know. The Kindle Fire can do so many things for the modest price. I just need to keep at it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is working well and learning more every day.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for my fiancee for her Christmas present and she loves it. It's got great picture quality, excellent audio and great response/reaction time!\n",
      "Positive :-> Do you spend lots of time on Amazon? Do you like listening to music anywhere in your home? This is the device for you. Even after a month of having the Tap, I'm still learning what all I can do with it verbally. Play genre of music in the HUGE Amazon library. I even have ordered items directly from it. One last feature I want to share is that it provides accurate weather information; current and forecast up to a week.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great experience! Purchased online, pickup in store\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my first kindle. I'm not sure how I lived without one now. The screen is excellent. I love being able to read outside (no glare!!) AND in bed (built in light!). Not sure how useful the automatic light adjuster is but it is a neat idea. Maybe as I use it more I will come to appreciate the automatic light adjustment.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you are an Amazon Prime member this tablet works well. It is designed so you have easy access to Prime Books, Amazon Music.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for the price. I would buy NVIDIA shield if it wasn't too expensive\n",
      "Positive :-> The eco is great if your a lists person or want to order Pizza. Yes it can control lights and locks but it doesn't support my remote lights I have now. The Eco just can't answer technical home work questions like the Google can\n",
      "Positive :-> It is nice to have an extra plug\n",
      "Positive :-> love the fire tv.. super fast uploads. Small and compact\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. She uses it everyday. Super light and easy to navigate.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this Kindle. I have read about 7 book since I bought it and I used to only read about two a year\n",
      "Positive :-> Had my original Kindle for 8 years with never a problem. When it finally died in December, I felt I could just use my iPad and Kindle app. But I missed the smaller and easier to hold Kindle more than I expected. Love the new paper white. No external light source required to read in bed, but easy on the eyes. Only regret I can't get my word games on it due to incompatibility, otherwise would be 5 stars.\n",
      "Positive :-> Replacement tablet for my wife - no complaints! She watches Netflix on it a lot.\n",
      "Positive :-> Overall a good First Tablet for a Child. I find it difficult to find a specific game on the Child User. The Adult User has a search feature. Not sure where the Search feature is on the Child User. My 5 yr old Grandson is enjoying the Tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product.....................................\n",
      "Positive :-> I have never been a fan of \"smart\" tvs, the interfaces of the best are terrible...The firetv interface is clean, fast and does what i want with relatively little fuss. These are a little more money than the firetv sticks, but much faster and have USB ports for wireless keyboards\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my first Tablet and I love it!!Easy to understand and there are so many apps I read a sample book and I like the huge selection of books,newspapers and magazines The lighting is perfect easy on the eyes\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this Best Buy! They are great and hook me up with the best deals :)\n",
      "Positive :-> I am no longer sitting alone in the basement watching Netflix using the kid's Xbox connection. I can watch Netflix upstairs and still remain somewhat involved in what the rest of the family is doing!\n",
      "Positive :-> More powerful then it's little brother. No hesitation at all. Love the fact that I can run a network cable to it instead of using wifi.\n",
      "Positive :-> The new tablet is great ！ nice upgrades！Love how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web.\n",

      "Positive :-> We bought this for daughter for christmas. Fantastic tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I used a Nook reader for several years but got no customer service when I needed anything. The Kindle customer service is truly first class and the reader is a quality item.\n",
      "Positive :-> My nephew broke his tablet and I thought this one was going to be perfect for him, since he's young he doesn't need a expensive one. It was on sale for Black Friday so I took the advantage and got it on time before Christmas\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for the price. The Amazon OS is a bit sluggish but this is great for kids or to just keep laying around the house.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is our second Echo; now have one upstairs and downstairs!Love having our favorite music available at any time and the sound is really good for the size of the unit. We also have access to instant weather and information on just about any subject you can think of!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use. Perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school\n",
      "Positive :-> Enjoying this product and anxious to learn more about it.\n",
      "Positive :-> How did I ever live without this the sound quality is amazing and extremely easy to set up\n",
      "Positive :-> So this is now hooked up to the Hue Lights and makes things a bit easier. Down side is now want to hook-up the apple tv/roku/tv etc and looking for an easy way to connect all these.Sound is good.Easy to installquick to train\n",
      "Positive :-> We're having fun playing with that but sometimes it doesn't answer the questions that you ask it which is a little confusing for us\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought this for my 86 year old cousin so she could download library books, play card games, and, most importantly, watch what her kids and grandkids post on Facebook. I myself have a Fire and found it very easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like this device because it keeps my niece and nephew happy while on the road. For the price, it can't be beat. It's not as intuitive as it could be.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have always enjoyed reading. I read to quickly and eventually spend a load of money on one book series. This product has already saved me at least $80, and i've only had it for a month. Yes I did the math! I love this thing!\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome product. Enjoy using it everyday. Would definitely recommend\n",
      "Positive :-> In my opinion the fire tv is definitely one of the best streaming devices out there with its awesome performance and easy to use.\n",
      "Negative :-> I PURCHASED THIS ITEM BACK IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017. I RETURNED THIS ITEM WITHIN 30 DAYS OF PURCHASE. I MAILED IT BACK PER INSTRUCTIONS BY AMAZON. TODAY MAY 26 I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM AMAZON THAT THEY FAILED TO RECEIVE THE ITEM BY JUL. 20 SO THEY WILL CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD. I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT SOMEONE IN AMAZON RECEIVING DID NOT DO THEIR JOB LOGING IN THE ITEM OR US MAIL LOST THE ITEM. EITHER WAY I AM SCREWED.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids break stuff, not on purpose, but they break electronics. Rather than spend hundreds on other tablets(that might get broken), this kindle at this price was a no brainer. No bugs, simple menus, easy to use for kids 6+.\n",
      "Negative :-> Bought this for Christmas 2015. After about 9-10 months the battery began to fail to hold a charge. While the first 9 months were good -- as many of the reviews here laud this tablet -- the 90 day warranty is disappointing from Amazon. (When I did have a different Amazon device fail within the warranty period, their exchange was immediate and easy for a brand new device -- so the only warranty issue is with the length.)I'd recommend it if you just want a cheap tablet to throw in your bag but otherwise it's just average.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a grate product and the price very fare just so happy with my Kindle!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for my 9yr old, and a great price to go with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids love them and they have yet to break them! Unlike some others I've tried that cost twice as much.\n",
      "Positive :-> Though it's entry level tablet it's not cheap technology. Amazon ecosystem is very competitive with Google and they're ahead with more rapid product line. Fire tablet is the proof of that. You can also get advantage of Alexa.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to sideload Kodi on to it. A very wise choice, indeed! I no longer have to lug my computer out to my TV and attach via HDMI. It's ALWAYS on with AFTV! I haven't really used it for anything but Kodi and Netflix, but LOVE IT! Run out and buy this , NOW!\n",
      "Positive :-> bought for my grand Daughter who loves it, replaced and older Kindle, this works much better for her.\n",
      "Positive :-> I recently cut the cord to my cable and use the Fire TV as my streaming box for PlayStation Vue it works great easy set up, I just wish it had HDR\n",
      "Positive :-> My grand daughter wanted a tablet and this was a wonderful purchase for her birthday. The price was excellent and it does everything she was looking for and more. She never wants to put it down!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for destructive toddlers. My son has dropped and thrown it several times and it still works!...\n",
      "Neutral :-> Bought this to keep all my ebooks on to carry in my purse. So I could read when was stuck at the hospital, etc.Well, gee the free wifi at the hospital has a sign-on screen. Couldn't get to that. Did some reading (on my phone) I think I can fix it the next time I need to be there. Just disappointed that it wouldn't allow the sign-on page to display right out of the box!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I upgraded to the paperwhite after my very old Kindle died. I like the paperwhite screen. I hate that the pop up adds and recommendations have absolutely no connection to my reading history. It's very different from earlier Kindles so I'm still learning features. I can't understand why the paperwhite costs 2-3 times what the Kindle Fire costs.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy and fun to use. Nice to be able to now read e-books.\n",
      "Positive :-> excelent costumer service i love the store you will find everything\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for kids, the protective bumper pad really does help. The unlimited warranty gives piece of mind as with kids anything will break. Finally the 1 yr unlimited warranty to Amazon for shows and movies the kids can watch. Awesome deal for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for reading late at night and the reader is a easy way to read at night.\n",
      "Positive :-> These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip. Can't beat the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect! Perfect screen size, fast, and picture is beautiful! I love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I LOVE HOW AMAZON HAS \"CHILD ONLY APPS\". SHE CON ONLY ACCESS AGE APPROPRIATE MATERIAL\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the silver color and larger screen also easy to navigate\n",
      "Negative :-> was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store.\n",
      "Positive :-> So much better than my previous kindle, I've used my new kindle daily and I'm not much of a tech person. It is light weight and easy to navigate. The battery holds a good charge as well\n",
      "Positive :-> My 2 year old grand daughter loves it. Amazon has a lot of age appropriate apps to download. I know longer have to have my precious girl snatch at my phone saying \"My toy Papa!\"\n",
      "Positive :-> love this and the prospect of using it with other integrated products like nest.\n",
      "Positive :-> Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought these for my 3 college students. They love them\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the kindle fire.This is the eighth in my family\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the future, Siri/Cortina did help us, but it did not had open API access for customizing. Amazon took that opportunity and release Echo. Great product, lots of new commands coming out per week. Works with your existing home automation systems. This product did level set for any future product like Google Home.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an awesome little inexpensive tablet. It isn't the fastest but it gets the job done well. I just surf the web and watch videos online. I also downloaded the Spotify app and listen to music. Next I'll download Netflix. It gets the job done very well.\n",

      "Positive :-> Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it!\n",

      "Positive :-> Great price for this easy to use tablet for younger kids! Easy to get it going.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second Fire, I'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7\" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for basic internet access, reading kindle books and watching Netflix. Works great. No problems. Now, if you want to download a ton of shows, extra memory will be needed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good Amazon product , good camera and amazing apps\n",
      "Positive :-> As a regular Amazon Prime user that gets much of my staples through prime, Echo makes it that much easier.\n",
      "Positive :-> This device works like butter. Better than Roku. Tx\n",
      "Positive :-> We had one when they first came out. Not quite as good but still works great for the kids.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am very happy with my product. It's nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Amazon Echo for my husband because he loves music. I was expecting the sound to be okay, but not for it to sound as good as it does. The speakers are of excellent quality. He is very pleased with the quality of the sound, as am I.Even though we use the Amazon Echo for mostly playing music, telling the forecast and adding items to our shopping list, to be perfectly honest, Id love to have another one because we all use her all over the house and I hate having to unplug and move her.\n",
      "Positive :-> We now own the Echo and the dot and both are great and can't be recommended more\n",
      "Positive :-> Thos works great for surfing the web and playing games, lite and compact\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is one of the best products that someone has come with. I love it\n",
      "Positive :-> Great screen, very fast, very portable, and light.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was gift, and it was totally unexpected. It is amazing. I cant wait connect it to other equipment. The TV, The Thermostat. It's like being Captain Kirk.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this one as a Christmas gift. Employee was very excited to receive and still loves the tablet.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Good bare bones tablet for anyone if that is all you seek. Do not expect the performance of a $400 tablet for $50. I have wifi & bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine, no lag on a reliable network. This is an amazon based OS, not a traditional android system.... so it is all geared toward amazon advertising and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon account. It even asks for your credit card, but can be removed afterward. All apps must be obtained from their amazon app store, no google play store which is considerably simpler. There are ways around this of course if you know how. One more thing that is important and it is this... After more than a week, I finally noticed with more use that my screen has 2 spots with dead pixels which show up as solid white dots and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen. After searching & reading online, it seems there are very many reports of these tablets purchased from any source having this issue. Even read someone who purchased a 5 pack and had several units with dead pixels. Test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen. You may be fine but it pays to look. I did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though I still have the receipt, I already discarded the packaging. I am at the 14 day point today and could have still returned it otherwise, but honestly for all I use it for I am not overly concerned. Still whether 50 or 400 dollars, a brand new item should be free of defects. Again, so far I find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bones tablet is all you need.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 18 year old loves her kindle paper white! Very user friendly and easy to read!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my daughter. It was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. She insisted on using her brother's iPad constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it , this was a great investment for my family\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good tablet for what you pay for it. You can read books,play games and surf the web. The only thing I would have done differently is I would have bought one with more storage!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like this product, particular the translation function that makes reading much smooth.\n",

      "Negative :-> Fathers day gift. Bought the Google home, could not connect to his wifi. I took it back and got this. What a pain to set up. It was the new router he bought not the Echo.He likes it so far.\n",
      "Positive :-> Wife enjoys the smaller version and the non glare screen\n",
      "Positive :-> fast, easy to use, very sensitive, google play store captable, I will buy again\n",
      "Positive :-> I really enjoy this Kindle Fire. The ability for expanding the storage is a life saver.\n",
      "Positive :-> awesome little device, I had an apple tv before, this fire stick does the same thing and more for cheaper\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old and she loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for night time reading and outdoor reading!\n",
      "Positive :-> The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7\". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Echo. This is actually the second one I purchased. I use it to set timers and alarms. We also use it to play music for our son and when family comes over to provide some background music.\n",

      "Positive :-> This is the 3rd echo I now own along w one dot! Have one to my oldest for her dorm and she was really excited. The dot is used w my larger stereo so nonneed for the speaker and extra cost. I did however buy it on sale for $90 on Best Buy and amazon prime day. Amazing deal. Very loud speaker on the echo. Only con is it sometimes is so loud Alexa can't hear your voice to control it. Works with my nest thermostat and eventually with some colored lighting I plan to put in.\n",
      "Positive :-> As an existing Amazon Prime member, this is a no brainer. Has all the parental controls and kids can have a decent tablet that is durable for use, at a good price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Better capacity, faster processor overall worth the extra money.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love that it is lightweight and easy to use. My local librarian showed me how to borrow e-books and it is so simple to do. Perfect for me.\n",
      "Positive :-> One of the best streaming devices I have used. A++\n",
      "Negative :-> Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to useBattery life is goodEasy to read a book\n",

      "Positive :-> Easy to read screen in a small light package. Excellent battery life and even fits into my work pockets.\n",
      "Positive :-> It was a hard choice between high priced echo vs the cheaper dot but I chose the echo. I do like having the speaker internal and I will be able to add the dot later on to other places. You can download apps to have alexa more adjustable to you\n",

      "Positive :-> Perfect size tablet that can fit in a purse. Also, decent size screen for watching movies!\n",
      "Positive :-> I expected the drag to be worse. It really isn't..\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this item, along with an HD antenna to finally cut the cable. Prices were getting out of control with the cable monopoly. This product really delivers. All the entertainment you could possibly want at your fingertips. I use it to stream PlayStation Vue. After experimenting with all devices. I feel this is by far the best. As smooth as a PS4, but easier to navigate with the remote. I also use it to stream Netflix as well as some of the free content. Overall an easy to use great product\n",
      "Positive :-> I AM GLAD I GOT ONE FOR CHRISTMAS E A SECOND ONE FOR NEW YEARS!!\n",

      "Positive :-> I didn't want to spend a fortune on something, I just needed a quality tablet to read my books, check email, play on Pinterest and Twitter, etc. This price is phenomenal for the quality. I actually bought one as a gift a few weeks later.\n",

      "Positive :-> Kid friendly Great appsChild can learn many things with this tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the product, but I dislike that you have to download every app. I believe it should come with at least a few basic apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the second one I bought and been happy with this purchase. Has everything that Apple has and you can do a lot more with this one.\n",
      "Positive :-> a solid well made tablet that feels good in the hand. images are crisp & clean. works well with my hulu acct, hbogo acct, prime video acct too. the first few secs the video is blurry, then it clears up and plays fine. if you add a sd card the tablet automatically places apps & video on the sd card (if app allows) the great value for me is you can download amazon prime video (must be a current member) onto the sd card for offline viewing. i bet a lot of parents will love that for those long car trips. sound is good. BT worked well with my BT enabled stereo ( i streamed prime music & pandora). don't be put off by the screen resolution - it looks great. the new bellini OS is a MAJOR improvement over the old carousel format of days past. the new amazon app underground also adds to the value for prime members. the lock screen ads are not intrusive, once you swipe to unlock tablet they go away and do not reappear until you lock the screen again. if you're a prime member - this is the best 50 bucks you will spend!\n",

      "Positive :-> Still adjusting...had kindle fire and liked the ease of touch for turning pages, definitions and location in book. Paper weight is Much more difficult to maneuver, doesn't seem to be as touch sensitive as the fire. I have to repeatedly touch screen to get page to turn and definition accessibility also takes more work. Also, bookmarking doesn't seem to stay on page.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect size. Works great. Just as advertised. Has a long battery life.\n",
      "Positive :-> This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the \"Kids Edition\" box was not registered as a \"Kids Edition\" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the \"Kids Edition\" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a \"Kids Edition\" so it was returned.\n",

      "Neutral :-> the description sounded like the base unit was included with the coding game - which it was not.\n",

      "Positive :-> Excellent product blows away google. It's the way of the future. Try it out\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is well made, durable and reliable. I have had good experiences with this manufacturer. I recommend this manufacturer and this particular product. This product does exactly what I need it to do. Super easy to use. I have used other manufacturers in the past but have not always been satisfied. I am happy with this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this for my older son to be able to Skype with me over long distance. It is a great tablet and functions well for movies, games, and Skype.\n",
      "Positive :-> My granddaughter had been using her parents' iPad and loves using apps for learning. I thought it would be nice for her to have her own tablet. My daughter loves the parental limits that can be set and my granddaughter loves not having to \"share\" with her parents!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my kindle. Easy to use. My daughter has a kindle and we can share books.\n",
      "Positive :-> This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it\n",
      "Positive :-> My mom loves it! She uses it everyday for everyday us and to video char\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my wife when she lost her kindle on vacation. Easy to set up and start using. Amazon customer service is also excellent!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my mom. The touchscreen is not as responsive as my iPad. The camera is a little underpowered too. I didn't think it would matter much, but it is pretty pixelated. It serves her purposes and I knew it wasn't a high end device going in. She has been able to fumigate it out mostly, so that's been a bonus.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's has the perfect settings for my kids usage. Keeps her away from all the inappropriate stuff n she has easy access to any downloads that interest her. Only downside is she can't access YouTube kids.\n",
      "Positive :-> Every morning I ask what the weather is, and she tells me. Fantastic. She also does a lot more.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the white and black version as well as the dot and all products are great. They work in each room with wonderful sound and get smarter everyday with new skills.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the kindle. It is light weight and the back light is great. Easy to use and get book from the library or from Amazon.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love me some Alexa., Im looking forward to better software updates that come in daily. Speaker is good, just looking forward to the new stuff\n",
      "Positive :-> Exactly as advertised. Easy to read in the sun, no glare on the screen. GREAT battery life! I'm an avid reader and only have to charge once every few weeks. Love that the brightness is adjustable so I can read in bed after my husband has gone to sleep without bothering him. No strain on your eyes without a light on.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet to browse the Web, good for a beginner\n",
      "Positive :-> I already had an original Kindle Paperwhite and loved it. Buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but I am so pleased I made this move. I love the new font and the clarity of the screen. I love that the Kindle comes to life when I open the cover (I bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp). While there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the Kindle there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel I have made a great purchase which I am happy with. I also have a bunch of books from my Amazon.co.uk site which I access on my 'old' Kindle (I couldn't work out how, if at all, I can move books from one Amazon jurisdiction to another) so this has proved a good purchase all round.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for the price. The screen is pixelated but it's responsive and the touch screen works fine. Would buy again\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy way for my family to stream music and videos over our speakers. APPs are a hassle a lot of the time and limited storage capacity.\n",
      "Positive :-> Wife loves this Kindle as opposed to some of the others due to readability in bright light.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is a great source of knowledge. Love her!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Does what they want, games, educational apps, and has parental controls.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this when it was on sale to replace my old Kindle Paperwhite. Makes for a great tablet as well as an e-reader. Love all the different apps! And the blue color is so pretty!\n",
      "Neutral :-> It performs with no major problems and without excessive load times\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased as a gift gor fathers day and our while family enoys Alexa. New skills are always veing added. The sound is great and I really like that you can feedback on what she \"hears.\"\n",
      "Positive :-> I like this tablet alot but it was really hard to understand at first.\n",
      "Positive :-> It was a gift and can I say, it was a hit. When I go to my daughters house she is always telling Alexa to do something\n",
      "Positive :-> No complaints. Excellent for relaxing to read, enjoy a movie, or play games through the plethora of apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love paperwhite version. Perfect to read at beach, at night ,on plane, etc...\n",
      "Positive :-> I enjoy this product and HIGHLY recommended. You can not go wrong in purchasing this Alexa. It plays my smooth jazz while working in my office.\n",
      "Positive :-> She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine.\n",
      "Positive :-> bought for a 10 year old granddaughter but our 32 year old daughter loves hers also\n",
      "Positive :-> Very happy with the HD Fire 16GB. Plenty of memory and easy to navigate. I would definitely recommend this item.\n",
      "Positive :-> bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it. Bought this one for my husband. He loves it as much as I love mine.\n",
      "Positive :-> Much better than reading on my iPad, especially outdoors and at night. Portable size, great battery life, and must have for any serious reader\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it! The volume is great!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have enjoyed these little tablets and now they come with the micro sad card port making it better\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this item for my husband and he has liked reading Kindle books on it and the other features like Silk, etc. Light little tablet with good features.\n",
      "Negative :-> If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> The only con I see is the exclusion of the optical sound out put. The Micro SD slot is a nice addition.\n",
      "Positive :-> My mom was looking for a affordable tablet. I bought mine at best buy last November. I recommended the fire tablet and she loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> a $50 dollar tablet that will do more than an ipad...how can you go wrong!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this in order to read on it while waiting for appointments. I have a larger Samsung which I love but it's bulkier and doesn't fit in my pocketbook. This is the perfect size and battery lasts longer.\n",
      "Positive :-> My wife and I love our kindles because they're great out in the sun on cruises, at the beach or when sitting on the couch.\n",
      "Positive :-> One is adopting an animal to give it a good home - the other is buying an Alexa enable device like the ECHO. This marvel of tech is a must have that brings us one step closer to life on the USS Enterprise.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet for my wife to use for social media and looking up items for remodeling our house.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for gift for my 8 year old niece she loved it it's great for a starter and well priced\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loves it we like that it has a worry free gaurantee and parental controls it was\n",
      "Positive :-> We had tried in the past to use Netflix an it just wouldn't work, so I tried again after we got the firestick and it works perfectly. Occasionly there are some times where it cannot find a server, but for the most part it works great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this tablet, great price and is really fast. Is worth every penny.\n",
      "Positive :-> Wife loves it so makes my life better what else do you need to know past that.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use. Easy to setup. Great video quality...\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the ability to read in sunlight, create files.\n",
      "Positive :-> I mainly use this tablet to read my kindle books on but it also handles playing music and watching videos fine. Great for social media as well. A perfect first tablet for someone who has yet to experience a tablet or smart mobile technology. Definitely buy a decent sized micro SD card when you get it though, as the real space you receive after purchase is more like 4 GB because the OS takes so much space on the device.\n",
      "Positive :-> I brought 3 tablet for my grandkids and the love them. Its easy to operate and block off other web sites to make it kid friendly\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great Amazon Fire HD8. I love the size. So much better than my first Kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased several of these tablets. It's great for kids (all kinds of parental controls), but I also purchased one for my 80yr old Mother. She loves the ability to skype, check email and read her magazines and newspapers each day. She's also discovered (on her own) several games and apps in the AppStore that she suddenly can't live without. I love that when she gets stuck on something (if she can't call me) she can contact Amazon and they log right into her tablet and walk her though the issue (for free).CONS: It's slow... not for advanced users.\n",
      "Positive :-> The fire isn't going to thrill you like the iPad or surface, but it gets the job done. If you use Amazon video, HBO go, Netflix or any streaming device then it's a no brainer.\n",
      "Positive :-> My family received this Echo at Christmas, and it is used almost daily. Listening to music, adding to shopping lists, asking trivia, etc. we loved it so much, this now lives downstairs, and we have an Echo Dot in each bedroom.\n",
      "Positive :-> Can't beat the quality and performance of this tablet for $60. I bought it to be my main link with my Amazon Prime. But used it last week instead to download Direct TV app so I could use it to watch the FBS championship game. It worked great but it couldn't help my bama team win.\n",
      "Positive :-> I recently purchased this Amazon Fire for my daughter, i like that it has the little accent of a night light, so if we are watching a movie in the dark, she can still use it without illuminating the entire room. features are average, just like any other tablet. It is a little bulky but for a child, it gets the job done. Pretty sturdy when its dropped. Doesnt have much storage, but the good news is you can add your own SD to create more storage.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this kindle tablet. Its speed is awesome. And its a great device for young children.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device for cable cutters. I just wish it had vudu.\n",
      "Positive :-> We gave this to our son and his family. It fits right into their small patio and they are happy that our 5 year old granddaughter can play around it. It has endured heat, water bubbles, splash pool and her knocking it over.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really like reading paper white. I wish it listed the books the way my kindle fire dose like in a book case. But all and all I'm very happy with the paper white kindle\n",
      "Positive :-> Unlike the fire stick, this item does not over heat.\n",
      "Positive :-> I would definitely recommend this product for it's sound and quality!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to hold, access to some free games - just be careful if you have 1-click payment option. My 3 year old charged $16 to my account in 3 days. Good news - I received emails about the purchases and was able to get help in stopping the process from happening too often. She loves the \"FIRE\"\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this echo well worth the price. No complaints\n",
      "Positive :-> I was a little worried at first because I brought the tablet for my 7 year old but so far I have no complaints\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice work good look al my movies work great on my tv\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 4 already and So far my cousins love it. Still working great, easy to use, great size for kids.\n",
      "Positive :-> Mainly purchased for my kids to watch movies on long road trips. Put in a 64gb microsd card and you have endless entertainment!\n",
      "Positive :-> For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying.\n",
      "Positive :-> My family and i have a great time with ECHO. it is easy enough for my 4 year old to use for whatever she wants. great product.\n",
      "Positive :-> A great piece of technology. A wonderful convenience that helps make you day better.\n",
      "Positive :-> We wanted something you could read books on and watch shows through amazon and hulu. This meets those needs and then some.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had a nook for years and had a difficult time switching over to kindle despite the amazing reviews, but I couldn't pass up the price of this product. I was very pleasantly surprised with how great it is and I now use it all the time. I'm even thinking about getting my toddler one for christmas.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my wife and she loves it. Screen is easy to read indoors and out.\n",
      "Positive :-> Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great.\n",
      "Positive :-> I will be buying another Amazon Fire in Feb. for my granddaughter for her birthday.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best overall value among all Kindle readers. The built-in light feature is must-have.\n",
      "Positive :-> Smaller size. Easier to hold and put in my purse.love being able to read it at night and not keep others awake.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very satisfied with the size and performance and a great deal\n",
      "Positive :-> Black Friday deal, cheap and does what it's supposed to. Kept a little girl very happy and occupied\n",
      "Positive :-> It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had one before and I like the new camera feature on this one. Easy to use and the clear picture.\n",
      "Positive :-> i have bought both the fire stick and the fire tv. This product is by far the best streaming device available on the market. i would buy more but i dont have anymore tv's.\n",
      "Positive :-> Was nothing like i originally thought when in ought this . You have to put some work into it to get tor to work and does an ok job not perfect\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use for kids and elders. Very Basic functions.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love how it has a built in light and the fact that's it compact. Very easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> My son is non stop on this tablet it's fast. He can look up anything on it and recoding video is clear. He loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> So far, I've enjoyed all that the Fire TV has to offer and its functionality. It's very responsive and loads shows/movies/music instantly. The only thing that is annoying, is that the remote will intermittently not work. If I tap the remote, take out then reinsert the battery, it will work again. I've tried replacing \"new batteries with \"new batteries\" with the same result. Not sure if it's a glitch with emitting diode signal from the remote to the unit. It's not very frequent, so I tend to over look it. The unit and the remote will occasionally go through software updates, so I'll see if that takes care of it first.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for home automation, but havent gotten that far yet. Good for music, books, weather, etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> Small and easy to use. This was a great value on black Friday.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this little tablet. My daughter loves free time app on it. She wants to play on the fire tablet more than her kids Samsung tab\n",
      "Positive :-> The price is outstanding it works great for my use surfing the web. Little slow and the image is not super sharp but you can't beat the price. if you're looking for an inexpensive tablet this one is great!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Using Alexa for mostly music but also for weather, tides and research. Love not having to make up my own playlist. I can just ask her to play a musician I think of any given day. Very spontaneous!\n",
      "Positive :-> We were tired of cable failure via mediacom and we're looking for a cables and dish less tv system. A friend of one of our friends told us about the fire system. We went out and bought it then purchased sling. We are very pleased with this decision.\n",
      "Positive :-> Overall, this is a far cry from the more popular iPad, and is nowhere near as intuitive or easy to use, but as a less expensive option for my children to learn on it is the perfect fit. The price point is perfect for first time tablet users, though you will surely need to invest in a memory card to expand the storage capacity.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had read that the tablet supported gps, for Pokmon go. You can make Pokmon go work, but this tablet does not have built in gps, it uses wifi triangulation. It is great for watching movies, YouTube, and social media apps. It's also great for reading books.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> My new Amazon Fire TV works terrific! Great for streaming TV service, PlayStation Vue.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's ok, it's good for beginner users, the kids love it because they could play games on it\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for someone over 70 who likes to learn new things. Works great and keeps them on their toes for sure. It is fun and helpful, everyone ended up loving it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got my granddaughter one & i surprisely received one for Christmas! Now i can do more while laying in bed! And my grandbaby get to watch Nick jr. On jer own leisure!\n",
      "Positive :-> bought this as a christmas gift for our son, it holds a lot of games and is very easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> Great way to listen to your music through all of your accounts and play lists. The voice commands make it real simple. I\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is really great, not buffering when watching live streaming.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am an avid reader, and have purchased both the first and second generations of the Kindle Paperwhite products. Upon reading about the Voyage, I knew I had to have one. Although it's a bit pricey for an e-reader, it's definitely worth it for me. As much as I read, I believe the new screen will result in less eye strain. It's a beauty to look at. Especially when held next to the Paperwhite 2nd gen and compared.\n",
      "Positive :-> This device works great! Can't wait to get more items to sync with it!\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is a nice gift for my granddaughters , they spending a lot of time reading books on this and they have a fun time with the games . Love it\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it it works wonders great job greate product.will recommend to any friend\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great kindle for the price. Smaller travel size with enough power for general use. Does seem slower than other tablets but for a backup or travel companion, you can't beat it.\n",
      "Negative :-> The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is some advanced ass technology.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased for my toddler. Best investment yet. Also added the protection plan. Very happy with purchase. Serves it purpose.\n",
      "Positive :-> The fire TV is definitely better than the stick. The stick used to freeze on us, but the TV doesn't seem to have any problems or delays. It works exactly as it is supposed to and helps me find programs for our son when I can't find them in other places!\n",
      "Positive :-> Quickly charges kindle so son can use it. Worked great right out of the package\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a well built great sounding unit that gets better the more you use it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the compact size, ease to read, ability to easily access library and back lighting makes this a great product.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you want a cheap nice tablet get this one! It does everything\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet really is worth every penny I paid plus a lot more. My daughter loves it, it allows her to do everything she wants plus provides the durability needed. We haven't purchased a case yet but have not been pressed to either the back layer has a good grip, so she holds it securely with no slipping. She can access her school work, load videos to musically and video chat with friends.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is much faster than the fire stick. Streams clear every time.\n",
      "Positive :-> Have a few fire tv sticks but they lag a little bit. The box is worth the extra money.\n",
      "Positive :-> Finally a kindle for mom! Great value for the price!\n",
      "Positive :-> This was perfect for my 4 year old. She gets all the apps she wants and it works great. Even dropped it a couple times and it ls still in one piece!\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Echo is great!! Easy to set up and use in your home.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good value for the money. Quad core processor allows for consistent streaming.\n",
      "Positive :-> Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Would recommend this to a friend. We are enjoying it a lot.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bough this tablet for my father and he loves it. It's pretty simple for him to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> It isn't my first e-reader Amazon - Kindle, and last model - Amazon - Kindle Paperwhite is very-very good!\n",
      "Positive :-> I never have any issues with this company or products!\n",
      "Positive :-> Works just as advertised. 4K streaming looks really good.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is great! Unfortunately got a defective one at first, but Best Buy was happy to exchange it for us and had no problem doing it! I'm sure it was only defective due to the hundreds of people who were there on black friday shopping! Works great! Very satisfied!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought the Echo for my hubby's birthday, and it is everything I expected. It is so easy to set up, and we enjoy it so much. We use it to play music (such as a certain genre or artist or particular song). The sound quality is very good. My grandkids love to hear their songs too. We use it to make our shopping list, as it's easy to add things whenever you think of them, and no lists to lose! I definitely would recommend the Amazon Echo.\n",
      "Positive :-> I needed a gift for my nephew who was graduating from college and who seems to have everything. Decided on the Echo since I've been wanting one and thought he probably didn't have it. I was happy when he seemed excited about receiving it, but thrilled when he kept texting me the following week to tell me how great it was and all the things he had Alexa doing for him! I'm now even more convinced that I need one for myself, especially since I am moving toward making my house a \"smart\" home.\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet offered my son hours and hours of continuous learning and excitement he would not put it down until it went dead and the batteries had to be recharged\n",
      "Positive :-> Have another ereader but wasn't able to read it outside. This is much easier to read outside. It has lived up to expectations.\n",
      "Positive :-> A great tablet for my son. It has YouTube and parental controls as well as time limits.\n",
      "Positive :-> this is a fun gadget that can make a lazy person even lazier. Love the features\n",
      "Positive :-> I left my Paperwhite on a plane. I loved it so much I bought the same one again. No need to buy newer models. This works.\n",
      "Positive :-> Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from.\n",
      "Positive :-> Besides the missing app functionality (check compatibility before purchasing), it does exactly what I want it to.\n",
      "Positive :-> Delivery great handling and use for those wanting a natural reading device instead of the glitter of some technologies\n",
      "Positive :-> Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It's pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8\" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I'm getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love how it just makes our day even simpler. It's like Google for the home. Best addition of the year. I highly recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet for my 4 yo and 9 yo. Tablet was perfect for their use of watching movies and kid games\n",
      "Positive :-> I have bought 8 of these. They are perfect for kids\n",
      "Positive :-> The product works well. However, you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device, Alexa. I really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome!!\n",
      "Positive :-> This thing is garbage! Do not buy! It is the slowest charger I've every had. It is NOT a fast charger. It is a disgrace that Amazon is offering this product as a fast charger, and discontinued the previous all black square, blocky fast charger which really was a fast charger. This thing is NOT a fast charger. Save your money. Amazon needs to seriously check their supplier, the manufacturer of this junk.Advertising this thing as a fast charger is totally deceptive.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it!!! works very well.. I already had amazon prime service and was loving it for fast delivery and no shipping charges... Now, i am getting more bonus out of Prime for using Fire TV!!! works great. some of apps do not work very well. but, that's the app. most of app works fine. I am sure people will continue to fall in love with amazon TV and App will continue to improve.\n",
      "Positive :-> Positives:Not overpriced and extremely user-friendly OS. Recommend that users purchase an Amazon Prime membership if purchasing this item as there are always a ton of free TV shows, movies, books, and games included in the subscription. Prices for items are also reduced. If not, there are occasional free and reduced price items; however, you have to look for them.Negatives: If you do not charge the battery on a consistent basis, there is a chance that the Kindle's internal battery will not charge anymore. This will require the user to return the item and purchase another. If the user keeps too many apps open, the performance drops significantly. The display has a low resolution and the touchscreen does not always respond as quickly as a tablet would.\n",
      "Positive :-> After using the Amazon Fire Stick for about 6 months I decided to upgrade to the Fire TV and it is so much faster and I can hardwire it directly into my network unlike the fire stick which is only wireless.\n",
      "Positive :-> great reader for bed or the beach. definitely a must pack on vacation.\n",
      "Positive :-> We originally had a Fire Stick (and still use it with another TV). Once we subscribed to Sling, it seemed like streaming became more unreliable - increased buffering. We made two purchases to improve the situation: a Fire TV and a Wi-Fi booster. The two together definitely remedied the streaming issue. But the increased video crispness I/we give all the credit to Fire TV.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is just like reading a book only it's way more convenient! The background has the same look as the pages of a real book.\n",
      "Positive :-> Product is awesome. I love it it's easy to use and is fast.\n",
      "Positive :-> Wow, so impressed with this new kindle. Its replacing my 3rd generation kindle and its so much easier on my eyes. Also love the size, weight of the unit. Very pleased with this purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet is great for children's learning games and does appear to hold up on it's own for quality and strength under close supervision. Sound is loud and image quality good. Works well with our WiFi. Price was great also.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is much faster coming up to the start position than any other that I have had!So, I bought another one.\n",
      "Positive :-> Decent tablet for the price. Expect just basic use and function. This is no iPad be sure you aren't expecting that.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this with the intention of reading more, it serves it's purpose! I will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew, for his books and learning games.\n",
      "Positive :-> My fire TV did not disappoint !! I am able to do everything I wanted to do and then so much more !!\n",
      "Positive :-> Traveled for work to an island for 6 weeks. Was great for plane rides there and back, as well as on the island with me always being on the move\n",
      "Positive :-> Great addition to the home can take it to various spots in the home clear sound! User friendly, and easy to sync. Set up make sure u download the App in advance\n",
      "Positive :-> esay to read screen and fast operating systemgreat for a young adult\n",
      "Neutral :-> Good tablet but very limited in apps, only to basic surfing\n",
      "Positive :-> I have bought a kindle paperwhite as a gift for three people and each has LOVED it. It's a reliable reader with a LONG battery life and a great little traveler. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well. Works just like the fire stick but better because you can plug a Ethernet cable for a better connection\n",
      "Positive :-> Obviously talking about a budget tablet here so you obviously get what you pay for as always BUT this is a really decent tablet for $35 bucks (what i paid on black friday). does all your basic 'tabby' things and is very mobile. Great for those kids who feel the need for a tablet but you dont wanna break the bank haha.\n",
      "Positive :-> Surprised my son-in-law with the Echo. Such a great gift for everyone who loves gadgets and technology.\n",
      "Positive :-> I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can't seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn't transfer. I'll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a nice looking cover, will keep the Fire clean, but not particularly safe in a fall. (I have the black one. It is very professional looking.) No padding whatsoever. It does wake the Fire up when opened (and shut down when closed) but that has never been important to me. My problem with all of the cases is that you have to hold the cover out in order to keep the camera clear and it makes clicking the shutter a little awkward. I'd like to see an opening on the front cover that matches up to the opening on the back so you can have it folded in half and still be able to view the subject.\n",
      "Positive :-> Its a great technology to have at home for news and entertainment\n",
      "Positive :-> The kids love it! They love the different colors so that everyone knows which one is theirs.\n",
      "Positive :-> Main reason for getting the Amazon TV was for better streaming experience of PlayStation Vue. The Amazon Fire TV handles Vue streaming w/o issues and the interface is very easy and user friendly. I also like the ability to root the device for third party apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> Really super nice way to watch TV...I am a Amazon Prime member so I don't know how great it would be without Prime but with it it's the best way to watch TV...PERIOD!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device for tv show, movies, and supports 4k.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a very nice tablet for my younger daughter and especially the price!!\n",
      "Positive :-> We love this for checking the weather, music and alarms. Kinda pricey but I used my reward points to purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's very good for the price. No problems with the product\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this product based on reviews, and it fits the description as a near-perfect, reasonably-priced, all-purpose Kindle reader. The screen's front-lit display allows me to read under all lighting conditions, from bright sunlight to dark, without eyestrain.I bought the Paperwhite as a supplemental reader for my Samsung tablet so that I could read outside. After several months of use, I'm finding that I do all my reading on the Paperwhite.I read several hours a day and the battery lasts four or five days under that usage, which is a great change from my tablet, which needed a recharge daily, usually at an inconvenient time.I recommend buying the companion leather case because the case puts the Paperwhite to sleep with the cover is closed, extending battery life.\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet has been working fine, I would prefer instructions on the PC to explain how to do things versus on the tablet itself, but my older son is able to figure out how to do things and my 7 year old daughter (who got the tablet) seems to be navigating around fairly easily, so I am satisfied so far.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas has been s good tablet for her\n",
      "Positive :-> We purchased 2 of these for a couple of reasons. One because we were already Amazon Prime members and the other was paying too much for cable TV. Weve had them now for approx a month (one in the living room and one in the bedroom) and they work flawlessly. Easy set up (again if you're a Prime Member, just follow the on screen directions. We also subscribed to Sling TV for those channels we still wanted and purchased an outdoor antenna for locals. Fire TV has all the apps ready so they make it easy to set up what you want to watch. It can take a little getting used to apps instead of the TV guide on cable but if you have a smart phone its very similar. The Fire TV will not work with a standard IR remote so you have to use their remote provided but if you want to use only one remote for everything then I highly recommend the Logitech hub system that will control everything including the Fire TV. I have a TV, Blue Ray, Fire TV all connected through HDMI in my receiver and only have to use the one Logitech remote. Make sure you get the hub system since it works with IR, RF and blue tooth. Once everything is set up the Logitech hub app lets you control your system through your smart phone so there's no need to purchase more remotes. By the way, im not an employee of Best Buy, Logitech or Amazon just an electronics freak, but like things simple. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and won't go back to cable TV. One last thing, you still need a broadband connection, faster the better and a good wifi router to set this all up.\n",
      "Positive :-> I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.\n",
      "Positive :-> Does what I wanted it to do. Really like the way it performs.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought one and recommended this product also to my family and friends!\n",
      "Positive :-> i haven't been able to use it a lot yet. for now only use for music.\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm am not real good with computers but this is simple enough for me to use however I am still figuring everything out on it, so far so good.\n",
      "Positive :-> My mom's not to tech savvy but this opened her world and made every day things she does on her computer at her finger tips while comfortably sitting in her living room or on road trips! About road trips she can book a room just sitting in her car that might of unavailable once she got Inside. I have seen this happen. Smart phones are great but when you get older to have a full screen makes it much easier! She loves also loves to read and there are so many books on Amazon she no longer has to run out the door to the book store or library Very helpful and fun when she can sit down and enjoy a card game with multiple players all over the world when no one is home!\n",
      "Positive :-> This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100!\n",
      "Positive :-> It has all the features needed for my granddaughter and is easy to use. I'm am happy with this.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great Tablet for children...comes pre-loaded with lots of applications for loads of entertainment for younger children. It also comes with a 2 year warranty at time of purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this thing! I use it to control my Hue lights and music. It's a great speaker too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime\n",

      "Positive :-> We needed to upgrade to 4K and this made it available.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product! This is the best smart device that we have bought in so many years. The best of it is Alexa is getting better every day. We are having fun with Alexa every day me she became one of the best friends of my wife.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nothing flashy. If you want something simple that you can just grab and go, use with babies/toddlers, throw around etc then this tablet is great. If you want something a little more robust save up for one of the more expensive models.\n",
      "Positive :-> Ordered one of these for my son for Christmas. It worked for about 6 months and then wouldn't turn on. Tried several things found on the internet to correct it, nothing worked. Best Buy gave us a deal on a replacement as we were outside of the warranty. A great service from Best Buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loves her tablet I love free time love the case it came with just right to buy for a kids first tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> This product has great response to voice and the abilities are daily realized.\n",
      "Positive :-> A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple.\n",
      "Positive :-> Every time I ask Alexa for something, my 2 year old grandson runs over and tries to pronounce her name, he's almost there, hopefully he'll have a question for her as well. He likes dancing to the nursery rhymes that I ask her to play for him.\n",
      "Positive :-> I previously had a nook that died and tried the Fire and I was hooked. Great price and lots of things to do\n",
      "Positive :-> i am very pleased with this purchase. Thank you BB\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two of these for my 82 year old mother and 88 year old aunt - they love them! Easy to use! Great gift. Can't wait to buy one for me!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a major upgrade from the fire stick. Works extremely well no lag. Would definitely recommend to anyone that has Amazon prime.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the 4th Kindle we have.my wife had the older one she loves the camera and the size.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great value for the money. With Amazon's apps for kids it has been alot of fun and easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is a great entry level tablet. It is limited in both memory and function.\n",
      "Positive :-> have the amazon fire stick and box the box is alot faster worth the price love it have 2 of them\n",
      "Positive :-> I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use this for videos the quality is great I use headsets the speaker is good for quiet places not to loud.\n",
      "Positive :-> Had this for 2 days before I cut my cable off. Works great with lots of apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use reliable interface possible house hold money saver, if properly moded lol\n",
      "Positive :-> everyday this thing gets better! Great speaker quality and sound. The ever growing list of commands and functions ensure lagging interest and usability!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. An excellent alternative to the much more expensive Apple Tv. Gives you the option to display 4k context (Netflix) wich current version of Apple Tv does not allows you to do. I bought so that I can have the SlingBox app wich you can not get with Apple Tv, Sony Android TV, LG OS, or Sony Playstation 4.Great product. Highly Recommended.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for kids of people who don't need lots of memory\n",
      "Positive :-> I was surprised at every thing this little fire stick could do!\n",
      "Positive :-> The fire tv does not display in 4k.. it processes in 4k but cant display 4k.. This is because of the dumb design.. It still has a 1.14 HDMI port.. you need at least a 2.0 dvd port to receive a 4k signal.. You wont be able to tell until you hit your tv display resolution.. there you will see it still displaying in 1080p.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a low cost tablet. It offers many of the same features as higher priced tablets. Good buy!\n",
      "Positive :-> I like this a lot for an entry level tablet. I am able to watch videos and set it up to read books. There is some lag at times but nothing too bad. I had to add a memory card because the 8GB is small. Some apps can be downloaded to the memory card but it does optimize itself and will create space on the hard drive. The ads are only on the lock screen, never when using the tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great. Easy to use. Fast. Great for the whole family.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Kindle is exactly what my wife wanted and has worked out wonderfully.\n",
      "Positive :-> Was looking the a base tablet for reading and videos on the go. This more than what I was expecting at this price point.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this product because of family members and I'm so glad I did.\n",
      "Positive :-> love the big screen, clear pictures and fast loading. battery lasts long. I use it every day !\n",
      "Positive :-> Great sounding speaker and microphones seems to work well. Good options for playing music as well as easy to set up. Wish there were better connection with iPhone so it is easier to request and play songs from iTunes as well as to make calls from phone.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to go with the Toshiba 4K TV with built-in Chromecast I bought from Best Buy. It's nice when it works but I had problems with it that caused me to return it.I have a Fire Stick and it works great. I leave it plugged in but it needs to be unplugged every few weeks, otherwise it works fairly well. The Fire TV had to be unplugged after every use. The screen would flash and sometimes there would be a popping sound. If I left it plugged in for any amount of time, then it would not work well. I liked the voice search on it and Alexa works great. You can ask for the weather, play music, and presumably other things that the Echo, Dot, and Tap can do. Just a side note, you have to keep the button pressed when asking Alexa to do something.Maybe I had a defective unit, maybe it was something else. But I've had a Paperwhite and a Voyage that both died on me in similar ways. I've never had a problem with the lower end Kindles or Fire tablets. Based on my limited experience, Amazon just doesn't get its higher end products right. I'm still going to use Amazon for a variety of things, but I no longer trust them for the higher end products that they make and sell.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been playing with Echo for a couple of weeks. Its well worth the price want to hear a special song just tell the Echo bang she played it, sports scores you name it she got the answer.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have bought 2 tablets for my son and didn't open it after I received it because it was a birthday gift for them and when they open it on their Big day 1 of the tablet didn't turn on ,the screen is just purple I m out of country right now and will be back on August 4,2107 and I emailed BEST BUY \"Geek Squad \" and told them the whole situation but nobody responded,very disappointed it was a surprise gift for my kiddos and 1 of my son was really upset that tablet won't turn on,let's see if Best Buy read my review and take some action !!!\n",
      "Positive :-> is no word happy happy it hard to get up cause there no commercial so l have to fix something to eat before watching a move or do what l need to do frist so many movies it hard to pick what to watch\n",
      "Positive :-> Hassel free easy set up and use. Great price with superior performance.\n",
      "Neutral :-> It does everything that much more expensive products do, but it is much, much slower when changing apps. Once using the app, the very slow speed is no longer an issue.\n",
      "Positive :-> A fast and good quality tablet for the money that you spend.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love what it can do, and how helpful it can be. It is very easy to setup and then it just works. On top of that you can teach it more with skills. All in all this is a great little device!\n",
      "Positive :-> I would recommend this to a friend is anybody with little kids\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this kindle fire. Awesome product for an incredible price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought as gift. Excellent purchase. Would buy more\n",

      "Positive :-> The music and weather reports are terrific in addition to everything else.\n",
      "Positive :-> Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> No problems with it at al. Worth the money. Would buy again.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my mother who is not so savvy with tablets but this one made it easy for her to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I highly recommend this product for children with special needs\n",
      "Positive :-> Really nice and easy to use.It's my first tablet and I love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an amazing product. Enjoying it very much.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this tablet! It's user friendly and my kids love it! I'm so glad I bought this tablet!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for kids of all ages, purchased two tablets and they love them..\n",
      "Positive :-> Voice commands with Alexa is excellent. Home automation with Philips Hue is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my grandson for Christmas. It's a decent tablet for the price I paid. i find it much different than Samsung tabs or Apple iPad. so if you're used to these, amazon might not be a good pick for you. My grandson is disappointed we can't get YouTubekids on it. I've caught myself saying I should have paid a little more and gotten a Samsung. All in all, decent Tablet for a kid.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this as a christmas gift for my mom who isn't to tech davy. She loved it and says its easy to navigate.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this! Great for reading my ebooks, playing games and social media. At this low price you cant go wrong!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it! Has so many apps I can download that he loves.\n",
      "Positive :-> I read a lot on the iPhone and iPad which also have Kindle apps that are good, but there is too much glare on their screens on a bright, sunny day; this little Kindle without a backlight is a nice solution to that problem. The recent sale price made it practical to get one, and I'm glad I did.\n",
      "Positive :-> I would buy this item again. Fast shipping. No hassle.\n",
      "Positive :-> The product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspects.\n",
      "Positive :-> This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Amazon Fire for my daughter for her 8th birthday. It was decently priced. I can set parental settings and a curfew. I have to confirm what she wants to download. She loves it and plays games, listens to music, and reads books on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet. I have a I pad and I am just as satisfied with this tablet as I am with my I pad\n",
      "Positive :-> The Voyage, when it worked, was great - the page turns make the reading experience seamless and the ink is crisp, making it a real upgrade from the Paperwhite. That said, it started to freeze up quickly after I got it. Hopefully this is a software issue that will be resolved soon (and the price of early adoption, sometimes), because overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the (working) Voyage.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's very durable and Nice picture.its the perfect size for my 11 year old.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my gf since she is on her phone playing games etc. I've used it a few times and like it.\n",
      "Positive :-> He is a wizard with computers and tablets and knows much more than me.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have the Kindle Paperwhite from 2013 and my fiance just got the 2015 version. It's great to see added features without a change in price!\n",
      "Positive :-> GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an absolute life saver for small children.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle's keep getting better and better. I purchased this for my son who is an avid reader. He loves it and I love that he is reading more.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Kindle Oasis for my wife as a 37th-anniversary gift. She enjoys reading and I thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice. She tried it for a few days and didn't care for it. She writes notes in the margins and wasn't happy with the way the Kindle did its notes. For just reading I think it would be a very nice product.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like this tablet very much. Good for kids to use and cost is low. Quality of touch screen is excellent. My kid can watch youtube cartoons, play games perfectly.\n",
      "Positive :-> It worked as it should\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is awesome to use for hearing music. works well!\n",
      "Positive :-> I had no idea that Alexa would tell me jokes and play games with me! I'm still in the process of discovering all of the things my device is capable of. My only disappointment is that I get a lot of I don't know answers to questions that I expected it to be able to answer. Or maybe I'm not asking right??\n",
      "Positive :-> i love my Alexa,you can ask this thing anything and it will get you an answer\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter absolutely loves her new tablet. And it does do everything I wanted it to do for her. The free year of Amazon Freetime is an awesome bonus!! The only problem I have with it is that whenever your wifi gets turned off and then back on, your apps on the kids profile have to load again almost as if they haven't been downloaded yet. This happens if the wifi strength gets weak also and it really frustrates my daughter who is 4 years old. I wish that could be fixed because other than that, the tablet is GREAT for my daughter and she has so much fun with it!! I'm sure other kids will love it also!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Alea echo is hands down the best smart device manager I've ever owned.\n",
      "Positive :-> This amazon fire tv box is one of the best media devices available.\n",
      "Positive :-> Our first tablet. Purchased for my husband prior to a long train trip. Downloaded movies had Internet and was great for traveling.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had the old kindle with no back light .. this new one was a great price .. I still use both but this is great on a plane or in bed at night when I can just turn it off and I don't have to get up and turn my light off\n",
      "Positive :-> I read a ton and this had made if much easier for me to have accessible books! The light is perfect for my when my boyfriend is sleeping and I can't put a book down!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it ! Tons of options and endless entertainment\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a great tool to have I like playing my music on command or setting a timer for something cooking. Plus small enough to keep on your counter.\n",
      "Positive :-> Sounds great. Must touch to activate. Easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great improvement over the old kindle fire. Better size than the hd7. Not to big and not too small. Fast processing spead.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was impressed with the quality I got for the price. I would recommend this product ti others.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought the Kindle Voyage and it had a yellow tint on the top half. Found out later this is a defect on most. Also, the auto light part I didn't like. Much happier with this, and it's cheaper.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product! Easy to use! ihave Sony Vue tv service, Netflix and Amazon prime. Using all of these with just 1 remote makes things easier.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this item for my husband for Christmas. We were wondering if he would really like it as he usually just likes to read actual books, but he immediately loved it. It's very user friendly and he has enjoyed getting to know all the ins and outs of it. It is a great way to read a book, but it has so many other uses too. I'm very glad I purchased this item. It's proven to be an excellent purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got it for the kids and they love it. I am also a prime member as well there are so many great things for members, movies, apps, games and shows that are free. If you are looking for a simple tablet to help occupy some free time look into one.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display\n",
      "Positive :-> Runs great, no complaints. Nice size screen, nice specs all around. Cant do any better for 50 bucks\n",
      "Positive :-> I am not the biggest reader but this made me start reading again! Really easy to use and very easy to read off at night or in the bright sun. Very user friendly and lots of little things to make my reading experience more helpful and exciting. Originally got the basic edition Kindle without the back light and instantly returned it. Not having to have a well lite room was more than worth the extra forty dollars.\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought these kindles for a gift for the kids on Black Friday. The price was amazing and they are durable. I know we will get our money out of them. I love that there is parental control, you can password protect areas where you don't want the kids to discover yet. Overall, great value for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a pretty good product. Took a little getting use to navigate\n",
      "Positive :-> It's easy to operate pluse is good price range. It's great for teens.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for kids of any age. It's cheap and user friendly. You can even set controls so there is an age timer as well. It's perfect!\n",
      "Positive :-> My 3 year old got it for his birthday and he loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Let's me watch movies on road trips & overall good quality picture\n",

      "Positive :-> So far the 1yo loves it. I thought it would be too much, but no.\n",
      "Positive :-> This a great tablet for a child. Fully functional Amazon fire tablet with a special GUI just for the little ones . Plus a 2 year warranty no matter what happens to it. Definitely worth it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best investment I've made! Doesn't really buffer like the other sticks .\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent tablet for watching movies and TV. Get the extra memory SD card and you will be good to go.\n",
      "Positive :-> For this price everybody should have one of this tablet, it works really good\n",
      "Positive :-> I love Amazon Echo with Alexa. It can answer any question. The only downside is that it cannot play ITunes music. I'm hoping Amazon will change that in the near future.\n",

I like the Voice control feature to easily navigate through your favorite shows, movies and all.

      "Positive :-> Works well though I ended up getting the HD8 because of the bigger screen as storage.\n",

      "Positive :-> This is perfect for my 3 year old. He loves this. The charger can be a little tricky at times, so I do have to be the one to plug it in. I've made sure to download a few of his favorite things on it for when we are offline & it's worked just fine. I will be buying an SD card soon to give him more room though, but we haven't run into any issues so far.\n",

      "Positive :-> Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loves her Kindle Paperwhite and reads on it every night.\n",
      "Positive :-> After only 4 days, the device would not charge. It was plugged in each evening and on the 4th day, it was at 7% after being plugged in all night. This was our second Amazon Fire Tablet, the first one stopped charging in month 13, right after the manufacturer's warranty expired. Decided to get another one because it was a great deal, but sadly I've learned you don't even get what you pay for with this tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an Ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got the Amazon - Fire - 7 - Tablet - 16GB - Blue for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is user friendly and she is able to navigate and use the tablet with ease.

      "Positive :-> Alexa is not only fun to ask questions to, but she also tells jokes, weather, news, TV programs, how to spell a word, sports updates and any thing else you can think of. She is a hands free google. You can even have her send flowers for you. More and more aps are coming available. I love listening to either Pandora or Iheart radio, the sound quality is very good.

      "Positive :-> This is my first kindle but I'm loving it. I picked it up a few days after it was released. One of the things I love the most is I'm a reader but I am not a car owner so I get almost everywhere by bike. I got tired of lugging around heavy hardcover books from the library; now my Voyage weighs less than most paperback books. An extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket I wasn't using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes. I also love that I charged it when I got 4 days ago and it is still more than have battery power.\n",

Each one has his own user, so they can personalize their experience with it as well. Works well, does the job, and again, at a very good price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to navigate & get acquainted with. Charges fast, holds charge! Very pleased\n",
      "Positive :-> You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.\n",

      "Positive :-> I was buying tablets for two grandkids ages 5 and 10. These did the trick and I didn't have to spend a fortune. I also bought the protective cases to protect them...Great purchase!\n",

      "Positive :-> Fast response, voice commands are ok but not always accurate. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have a fire stick for the tv in the living room and I bought the fire box for my bedroom tv. The speed for searches are much faster.

      "Positive :-> I bought 2 of these Amazon - Fire - 7\" Tablet - 8GB - tablets.One for an elderly friend in her late 60's and she does great with it.Also bought one for my 11 year old granddaughter. Easy to use and quick response to downloads and window changes. I have been recommending it to lots of people who are short on cash but need a really good tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my girlfriend and she loves it! The paperwhite version makes the screen look like you are reading an actual book. Also,there are a lot of ebook deals daily and she definitely loves that aspect of having a kindle too.\n",

      "Positive :-> Wished it integrated with Google Play Music. Torn betwee Google Home and Echo because of this. But if you have wemo smart home like us. It works really well. Half our switches and plugs are wemo controlled. \"Alexa turn off all lights.\" Really works! Google Home currently doesn't support Wemo.\n",
      "Positive :-> We all love the Echo. My son loves getting weather, music and jokes and we are starting to set up the house for remote control through the device. Very helpful device. Can't wait to have more of the house connected.\n",
      "Positive :-> After purchasing 4 Amazon Fire tablets i immediately noticed the amount of advertisement they came with at the pricing of the tablet that I bought. There's always some kind of advertisement on the screen when it wakes up. My other issue is after adding a card to make a few purchases for some apps for my kids. I removed the ability to make purchases without a password, well that did not actually happen. For a few days my children were able to make purchases in apps without any props that said; are you sure or asking for a password. I've had to completely remove the accounts and reinstall a different account for them to be able to stop making purchases. I also had them transfer the purchases to the new email a big hassle. Overall the tablet works good great for the kids.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product, for a very good price! Loved this tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product bought it as a Christmas gift. I will be purchasing another one soon.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is one neat little tablet. Can be used to surf net or read. I use it for both. Light and comfortable to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this because I previously has the kindle paperwhite but it had died. being kind of limited on funds but needed a kindle due to all the books I read I opted for the fire. I love it. I'm able to see the covers which entice me to purchase books so I remember books easier than before. I also can do more things on the fire and the price is $100 less than the paper white kindle...\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use and navigate. Great for watching movies and videos!!\n",
      "Positive :-> When companies play nice with each other... the customers win. This product is fairly novel if you aren't completely bought in to the Amazon ecosystem. I would use it way more if they played nice with Apple services. I know it's a competitor, but if both companies goals are to build an awesome product for a customer, they should play nice.\n",
      "Positive :-> I asked my Alexa to put on the music, what time and date and put my shopping list. Oh and how to spell thinks.\n",
      "Positive :-> You can go cheap and get the fire stick, but for $60 more this is worth it. Ignore the bad reviews, as in October 2015 when it was released it had several software bugs which are now fixed. I did my homework on media devices and the newest Roku & Apple TV's doesn't compare to this Fire TV box. The only thing you'll get semi better luck with is the Nvidia shield, but you'll also pay almost $100 more for it versus this fire tv box.\n",
      "Positive :-> She listens and does what she's told. The whole family loves Alexa.\n",
      "Positive :-> We are wanting to automate our home and purchasing Alexa(Echo) was the first piece to this pie. We do not have any true automation components yet, but I have been using this to listen to music while getting my house decorated for Christmas. It is sooooo easy to use and it understands requests on the first try. I love Alexa and cannot wait to get a few more products to \"teach Alexa new skills\".\n",
      "Positive :-> Great eReader for the price. Amazon Prime member. I use eReader when I travel.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is safe .. love the thick case & its fun fir my kids\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a fantastic tablet. I take it to workAll the time.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this as a bedroom TV. The picture is great and the sound is good too. Definitely worth it for the money.\n"

I quickly learned this is not the case. You aren't able to just plug it in and expect it to know everything on the internet. It seemed it didn't know know some basic questions. It uses skills where are like phone APs. You have to enable each skill in order to use it. When you want to use a skill much like an ap you have to remember the specific skill and then Include that in what you ask it to do. It seems like it does home automation well and basic functions but it has a long way to go before it's a know everything on the internet\n",
      "Positive :-> I don't think it's the adapter which seems to work fine. I just have to charge my new kindle lots more than the old one. It's probably the new Kindle's problem but I'll charge it with my old power adapter just to see. I charged with my old adapter and it was the same as the new one. So go ahead and buy this adapter\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet just what my wife wanted, loves the wifi, much better than her old one.\n",
      "Positive :-> How about this for my uncle as a present and he loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> The fire is a very inexpensive tool and toy for those of us just startuing to explore the world of diwloading.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my granddaughter as a Christmas present and she loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I own 3 firesticks for every tv in the house never had a problem with any of them . Wanted upgrade and saw some reviews online and I'm glad I got my hands on the firetv. With a faster processor expandable memory is just perfect for kodi the next. Big thing next to the nvidia shield which I own as well. I will definitely recommend it .\n",
      "Neutral :-> It's good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited.\n",
      "Positive :-> Made life so much easy... reads news, weather, time, shopping list, to do list.. without us having to look at phones... awesome product\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a starter Kindle for my grandson. Since I already have a Kindle Fire Tablet that I love, I had no hesitation buying this for someone else. I chose this tablet because of the childproof case and the extended replacement warranty since the gift was for an adolescent boy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for the price if you are a user of Amazon's services. Plays movies, videos , music from Amazon's Prime service great. If you don't use these, it is an OK android tablet. Does not support the Google Play Store directly but can be sideloaded. Not a great experience tho.\n",
      "Negative :-> Bought this for our daughter to use, but nothing worked right and was difficult to use. It's a fairly cheap $$ product, and it shows. Ended up returning it and buying a Samsung the next day.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet conked out on me the first day I powered it on. The Amazon symbol came up and never went past that screen. I was highly annoyed because I purchased it as a first to send it out of the country. My biggest mistake was trusting that everything would work fine, instead I should've powered on the device to ensure everything was fine.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet for ~$35 is an amazing deal. It's almost a no-brainer to get one for any long family trip.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email.\n",
      "Positive :-> My mom lives her tablet! She is obsessed with it!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this tablet for reading and letting my son who is 4 play games on it. The resolution is not the best in the world but I do not use it to watch movies for hours on end. I wish it was not locked to the Amazon market so that I could get a wider selection of apps than offered, but still good buy nun the less.\n",
      "Positive :-> its for a gift\n",
      "Positive :-> I love how this box allows me to combine my Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and a bunch of other useful hubs in one. It's user friendly and the voice remote is a lifesaver. No more typing in search boxes!\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to use and cheap for its price. I would recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my daughter's for Christmas this is a great gift it helps them learn and keep them out of trouble thanks again Best Buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> This device can be a very load speaker, I mean really LOUD. It also can access AMAZON prime service without a computer. I like this little Tap.\n",
      "Positive :-> We got this tablet for our grandson. The ease of operation is definitely thumbs up.\n",
      "Positive :-> I don't have a smart home, but it does so much more than that! I got mine strictly for my own entertainment! I have not been disappointed! My daughter has a smart home and I got to see what it did for her. While controlling her lights and thermostat is nice, I am happy with playing my favorite songs. It will give me the forecast as I lie in bed! It sang me happy birthday!!!! I am still finding all of the neat things it can do!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Firestick provides opportunity for families to spend more quality time together with many features and endless supply of movies\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the product. I'm very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a surprise for my fiance, he loves it! It has quickly become a standard part of our daily routines.\n",
      "Neutral :-> I was excited to get this because of the price. After taking it home I started noticing things that bothered me. I use samsung devices and the amazon app store does not have a lot of the same apps. Even chrome would not work on this device. I did return this because I was looking for more than a bare stock tablet. But if that's what your looking for its great!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is great for learning for little kids. Easy set up. in about a hours time my 3 yrs grandson new how to navigate through the whole system. Well made for kids in mind.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.\n",
      "Positive :-> Longtime Apple user, but for this price vs an iPad you can't beat this product!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this to carry around for Internet and gaming. So far very happy.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for my husband a few weeks ago. My husband loves Amazon Echo, I should say Alexa! This is very fun to use and ask questions and get answers, and so much more, only limit is your imagination...I think my husband likes Alexa better than me. Just joking, maybe not...lol.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Paperwhite was what I expected. It's easy to set up an account, and I can use it outdoors in the sun. Sadly, downloading library books is not as user friendly as I had hoped, but Amazon is in the business of selling books, not lending them.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a gift for my daughter. She had a very old kindle that wasn't working properly. She loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was so much fun after we set it up in our kitchen.\n",
      "Positive :-> Helps grand daughter with proper pronounciation of lots of words and names.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have owned the apple TV 1,2 gen; Amazon fire stick, direct computer to tv hookup via hdmi cable, roku and none compare to the performance and GUI of this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second Kindle Reader. Purchased the first one in 2011, but it was stolen this past Spring. So I purchase this Kindle Paperwhite. It is great No glare outside and it is easy to adjust the print size.\n",
      "Positive :-> bought this as a gift for my mom send she loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> Very decent tablet. I was skeptical at first but it's performance surprised me. Battery lasts a decent amount of time and connects beautifully into the Amazon ecosystem I already am in. Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch videos/browse the web on the go or for children.\n",
      "Positive :-> This works well, charges book readers quickly and easily\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this item on Black Friday and it did not disappoint me! Due to recently losing my previous Kindle Fire HD, I was seeking to purchase another. I came across the Kindle Fire and had to have it. It has an awesome display, great price, user friendly, and it is the perfect size for travel. I love it and would recommend it to anyone!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up. Love the Alexa integration. Very happy!\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it the size easy to carry and store would recommend to others\n",
      "Positive :-> I don't know why i waited to long to get this product especially since i have amazon prime. Gives me instant access to prime movies and has built in alexa what more can you ask for. Simply great .\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this device, enjoying everyday its in my home. I actually purchased another one.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is lots of fun and can do a lot of things. The only thing I would add is the ability for alexa to call 911. This would be a great feature for seniors and people with disabilities, or for anyone in case of emergency.\n",
      "Positive :-> A great addition to this product is to add Kodi for all your movie and television show needs\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet was a gift for my mother-in-law. She is technologically challenged and was able to set it up and use it with ease. Great multiuse tablet. The size is ok. Get the 8\" if you are like me and like a little more screamReal estate.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great device easy to use and easy to read especially in sunlight.\n",
      "Positive :-> Mainly used for reading kindle books, but tablet does many other things! Goes with me everywhere I go!\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is great. I bought it because it was cheaper than paying a cable bill.\n",
      "Positive :-> Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is great. Very fast and responsive and allows you to cutomize however you feel.\n",
      "Positive :-> If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is good for basic needs, weather, timer, streaming, but lacks the ability for proper search abilities like google. Also, the ability to stream books needs work.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this black Friday for 34 bucks. Cheap but reliable and nice. I would recommend this to everybody. It's fast and nice looking\n",
      "Positive :-> After reading scores of reviews on multiple types of units, this Amazon Fire TV was the choice for me. VERY happy with my purchase!\n",
      "Positive :-> this was a choice between the Oasis and the Voyage. i made the right choice\n",
      "Positive :-> I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read\n",
      "Positive :-> Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my three kids and so far there are no complaints. Easy to use!\n",
      "Positive :-> So far this has been a great product. Very easy setup and the remote fits nicely in your hand, similar to Apple TV remote but larger\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my husband and he loves it, so easy for him to get information, he's not one for computers and this is a magnificent substitute for his needs.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased it for a gift but i have to do all the up keep and maintaining. I've been a long time prime member who has many kindle books. I see this can be good for reading out side, it's lighter than a tablet and you don't have to charge it alot, the battery lasts a long time...Setup is straight forward and doesnt take alot of instruction to use it. It displays adds while its off, but it didn't bother me at all. It took me but a few minutes to setup and learn how to use the device.If you have prime you should see all your books right away but If you don't have prime but have someone in your house that does you have to setup a household and share everything to my wife so she was able to see all the books that i had purchased (i can be selective after they are shared). One thing i noticed was there is the kindle lending library, it only allows 1 book to be borrowed per month. Recently Amazon came up with Prime Reading, so you can take out multiple books at a time but you have to do it thru the web or a tablet or phone using the kindle app, which after they are taken out the kindle will see.\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought the Echo after visiting relatives that had one. Had so much fun we just had to have one too!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Was a great birthday present for my son that only gets to use it when it's absolutely necessary.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have the second generation Kindle Paperwhite and the new Voyage is far superior to it. The resolution is much sharper, the back light is much brighter and the power button location is much more convenient. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet for my grandmother and rooted it to remove all the amazon ware on it. She isn't technologically savvy but has loved playing with this tablet and is becoming a youtube expert. Can't go wrong for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect gift for my mother and mother in law. Easy to use wonderful graphicsAwesome tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> Buying this tablet, has been GREAT! LOVE IT. Now I can get on the internet, when I am in my chair\n",
      "Positive :-> My old kindle had no camera and was much thicker. This one has a great camera and is much slimmer.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good little tablet that takes a mini memory card. It is a little slow to load at start up, but otherwise is very handy and fast. Light weight and good for travel. At this price point ($50), I would not hesitate to recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a wonderful way to cut the cable cord! We have Amazon Prime, so our Viewing membership is paid, and there are so many TV show series/movies to watch, especially with Kodi loaded on the unit. We rounded it out with an inexpensive Sling membership, which gives us the live TV we need for current news and network shows. We are saving so much on our cable bill and couldn't be happier with our viewing experience!\n",
      "Positive :-> If your tv is not a smart tv and you don't have a gaming system this is the appliance for you! Easy installation and very portable so you don't even see it!\n",
      "Positive :-> REASONABLY PRICED. HAS MANY FEATURES OF TABLET COSTING MUCH MORE. DAUGHTER REALLY LIKES IT.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have always been pleased with Kindle Fire. In fact, I think I wore out my previous one. For some reason I cannot turn this one on and went to Best buy to ask someone to help me with it. But it seems you need an appointment even for this probably simple chore.\n",
      "Positive :-> How can you not love it? It provides convenience. It works great to borrow books from the public library. Just imagine all the savings on hardbound books.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the picture quality and the voice feature on the remote is priceless. Would buy again!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> A really low price for an amazing little pad. Quad chip\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent Black Friday deal. My 17 year old son was very excited to go to Black Friday, so after Thanksgiving dinner we walked down to Best Buy and were so surprised to find it busy, but organized and easy to see items and find great deals!\n",
      "Positive :-> So far we like. Wish I could control tv. It's lil expensive but seems to work great. Decent speakers as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent amazon fire stick. Set up was a snap. It is great that you can speak into the mic to search for a title of a movie or show, rather than typing it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good deal and a great price. Wish the Geek Squad knew more about combining kindle accounts\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for the money. Able to do everything a higher priced tablet does\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this, does exactly what they said it would and more,\n",
      "Positive :-> It has been useful for college looking up information I don't understand and for downloading books. It is also great for downloading apps such as Facebook, messageer, yahoo, google, Google maps, and the weather. It has also been great for downloading games.\n",
      "Positive :-> We love these so much we've put one on each floor of our house so we don't have to move them from our basement or living room.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire TV is great and works very well. Not disappointed at all.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is great and helpful when needed. Controls my house lights from philips hue and wemo and harmony remote.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves this Kindle. It is a good size and the price was right.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it's cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for reading - nice image, easy on the eyes and lightweight.\n",
      "Positive :-> Text looks great on it. My only issue the the browsing ability.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had a Kindle for years, but with two granddaughters fighting for tablet usage, I purchased this Fire tablet for double duty-theirs and mine. I've always loved to read in bed but also love to highlight passages and mark pages--which is hard to do while lying in bed. This tablet lets me read numerous books at once, whichever one strikes my mood or connects to what's on my mind. I haven't really used it for books with the grandkids, they like to watch favorite videos or play kids games. Gotta remember to juice it up for when they show up unannounced!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this primarily to use as an e-reader. Got it on Cyber Monday so it was a pretty good deal. I live in the Google ecosystem so I loaded it with the google apps after buying it. I pretty much ignore all the amazon stuff. If I want to use the internet I either use wi-fi or access it via using my phone as a hotspot. It is a decent size for reading, although I think I would have been better off with 16 gigs instead of 8 for storage. I have installed a 32gb micro sd card for extra storage.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card.\n",
      "Positive :-> The echo is a great addition to our household. We love it so much we give them as gifts to our friends who don't already have it!!\n",
      "Positive :-> great for movies.Works better with a bluetooth mouse\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this tablet for my grand daughter and she loves it. She loves playing her princesses games on it. We even got most of her videis on it so she dont have to have internet to watch them.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great in my entertainment setup. My only real complaint is that you can't control it directly using an Echo - currently using a Harmony Hub.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was discounted on Best Buy better than Amazon. It is a great device and even better $50 off\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Fire was a great price and exceeded my expectations.The picture is so sharp.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've been using a Kindle almost exclusively and decided to give this one as a Birthday present. Very excited recipient!\n",
      "Positive :-> This Kindle fire is amazing. I love how kindlely and fiery it is.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this onblack friday for $35 AND ABSOLUTELY love it. Thanks Best Buy\n",
      "Positive :-> Very happy with this product. I was all we expected it to be\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well for my 86 year old mom. She can see print very clearly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Can use it for best streaming. Can watch all the shows in best quality. Nice piece of equipment when we have no T V\n",
      "Positive :-> Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids love this tablet and I love the price so it's a win win situation\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for my wife. The tablet is easy to setup, not very bulky. This is a tablet for casual use and not for any serious use. Simple interface and easy to use, great product as the first tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids loved it. They use it daily. I would recommend to any parent.\n",
      "Positive :-> Durable and small, makes it easy for taking any where. Price isn't bad either.\n",
      "Positive :-> got one for me and for my older daughter. love it a lot\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web\n",
      "Positive :-> I got it as a gift for Mom. She loves it! It is not to complicated.\n",
      "Positive :-> I recently bought this on sale at Best Buy for $34 on Black Friday and couldn't be happier. While I wanted primarily an e-reader (which this does very well) I also use my new 5th generation Fire 8 for Facebook, CNBC, Fox, and CNN news updates, Alexa queries, and occasional email. I added a 32gig micro disk and now store all my Amazon e-books on it (and yes, you can save all your e-books onto the micro disc. Just read the documentation as it's easy to do). While the Silk browser is not the fastest browser in the world it works just fine for my needs. I also added two security apps via the Amazon app store to keep me protected. They seem to work well so far. The screen resolution is acceptable for my needs and while I haven't downloaded any movies yet, I'm confident they will play well. I should also add that I had to separately download an update from Amazon to install Alexa. While doing I needed to call Amazon tech support and they were excellent and very customer centric, responsive, and helpful.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a gift from me to myself. I am very pleased with this purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was originally just looking for a cheap but reliable tablet, on a post-birthday afternoon, when I learned Amazon was selling a low budget version of the current Kindle generation.While my opinion is slightly biased due to some personal modifications, I can say this is an excellent purchase if you're looking for a portable browser and book reader. A fairly decent and accurate battery. Sound is low in volume but reliable. Expandable memory works for applications, so dozens of apps can be added quickly. While I can personally say it's extremely durable compared to iOS devices. A small fall against smooth stone does not cost anything but extremely fine scratches only visible in sunlight.However, by default, you're extremely restricted by the Amazon marketplace, which is nowhere near as updated and expansive as Google play. If this could access both stores, I'd give it a 5 out of 5.\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought this to replace my children's aging Ipads and they're very happy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my younger sister. She's 9 and uses it to stream Netflix and play games. She tells me it's fantastic\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my kindle paperwhite. My first one lasted years and I immediately went and bought a new one and that one no longer worked It's great for night reading with the back light\n",
      "Positive :-> Good sound. family has fun playing games, listening to music and got an opportunity to use amazon at a great price!\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter bought this with her birthday money. She loves it and is always playing it.\n",
      "Positive :-> love the fire tv . best buy shipping is great very fast ship.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love, Love, Love, my hubby absolutely loves his new Kindle fire. Great picture and easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is so far the best Kindle I have ever owned. I love the screen and the resolution on it. The device out performs all of the other e readers on the market.\n",
      "Negative :-> I wasn't really impressed. The remote broke within 1 hr of using it and had to return it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I already had two DOTS (one connected to my main stereo via the aux line), but I wanted a stand alone Alexa device for a large bathroom suite. No real complaints other than value. I think this should be more like a $129-139 device. The speaker quality is pretty good but I expected something closer to a high end stand alone bluetooth speaker for $179. Still, I don't regret the purchase and I would make it again. One other factor that didn't affect the way I am using it....unlike the DOTS...the ECHO cannot be used with earbuds because it does not have bluethooth sending capabilities.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great! My echo answers all my questions. Very happy I purchased it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon did it on this one. I love my Echo, from checking the weather to asking random questions. I plugged mine up at the store and played with it for 30 mins with other customers and employees. This thing is a must.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great. I'm cheating on Siri with Alexa, She gets me!!! Well done AI, seemless intergration with other smart products. Just a joy to have around. Microphone picks up commands from a distance. Very well done. I bought 2 Echo Dots for other rooms.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great gift has every thing you need to have fun\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. Best buy had the best prices around.\n",
      "Positive :-> I feel the on sceeen page turner is a little slow and also slow switching between screens.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my wife and she loves it! No problems reading on the beach.\n",
      "Positive :-> Oh my goodness! I cannot imagine what I did BEFORE I had my Alexa Echo (and I now own 3 Dots around the house). I am always asking questions, setting alarms and timers and playing great music! Works perfectly for me and she understands almost everything say but I have a very distinct, clear voice and of course, it's all in how you word what you are asking for. LOVE IT!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my wife who loves books. She was always agents ebooks but now she can't be without it.\n",
      "Positive :-> My husband and I were looking around for a tablet for our daughter. We wanted something that she could use easily and we wouldn't have to worry about what she was doing. With the different profiles and parental controls available we have enjoyed our choice of this tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great gift for kids. Play a long time with battery life.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product kindle fire got one for mom and dad for Christmas presents nice to add storage\n",
      "Positive :-> The size, speed and battery are perfect for students to use on the go or just hangin in their rooms.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for the kids to keep them quiet, it a\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love my Amazon Echo. I purchased the Echo Dot for a second room!! I love to play \"old school\" music and it has found some really fantastic music. Very helpful in answering most questions. I have so much more I am planning to do once I learn more!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is one great tablet. I download books from my local library and read them on the go. I love the WiFi and everything about this tablet. I only paid $49 for it, but it is awesome!\n",
      "Positive :-> It has a great picture. But, This is not different from the original fire stick.\n",
      "Positive :-> Needed an inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly.\n",
      "Positive :-> 2nd kindle liked the first one better space bar located to close to change menu icons download is slow and have great internet service, device freezes up a lot and have to shut down and reboot, must close out any open tab to open a new one one happy with this model\n",
      "Positive :-> Easier on the eyes than my Ipad. Purchasing at Best Buy was convenient with online order/pickup and they matched the Amazon price!\n",
      "Positive :-> I'd say for the price it was a decent Tablet it did what I needed it to do but the support I'd say through the App side was a bit rather weak which is the big downfall of this tablet. Amazon also does a lot of advertisements on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple pages on your home screens which can be rather annoying and unremoveable. Otherwise I used it to watch videos, surf the web and use a few social media apps. Good for kids too both videos and games side. So I'd say in general for the price it's a decent tablet, but if you are looking to do more and have a smoother tablet you might want to pay more for something better.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option.\n",

      "Positive :-> This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015. Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.Before I start, Ive noticed several complains about Kindle not supporting the ePub format used by Canadian public libraries. Dont be put off, theres a solution in the Frequently Asked Questions section below.This review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. If youre in a hurry Ive included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end.Summary - What can you do with it-----------------------------------------* Read a book. It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday.* Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection* Borrow a book. Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books (if you have Amazon Prime Membership)* Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family* Highlight a section. Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated.* Record a bookmark. To come back to it later* Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position* Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder* Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the X Ray feature.* Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks* Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or family sharing)* Access every book you've ever owned on the cloud - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G..What Devices are available--------------------------------As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:-1. Kindle 6 (around CDN 79)2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) - around CDN 1292. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) - around CDN 139-2093. Kindle Voyger - around US 219-289 (Doesnt seem to be on sale in Amazon Canada)4. Kindle Fire - 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around CDN 300-400So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. Which to buy Here's a quick summary in order of cost.*** The entry level Kindle ***An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display. Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours.*** New Kindle Paperwhite ***Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage. The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original Paperwhite to 6 weeks - but still a very long time.Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new Bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.If you have an existing Paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. However, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance.*** The Voyage ***Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. It has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. The back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new Page Press buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch). It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. In addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device.*** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer ***The Kindle Fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range. Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks. Although you can read books on a Fire using the Amazon Kindle App, youll find the Kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. Youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated book reader device.Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.What other options do I have----------------------------------Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:-* Special Offers - ie. adverts* 3G or WIFI connectionPersonally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle. They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.The 3G option is a more difficult question. This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books over-the-air instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot. Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. Of course if you wont have WIFI at home, then youll need the 3G option.One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a Personal Hotspot or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to. Got to Settings Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while youre out and about.Conclusion-------------If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option. Youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite.The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen. Finally, theres the top of the range Voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.If youre in the market for a Tablet Computer then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the Kindle. Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2. I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus.Frequently Asked Questions---------------------------------Q: What file format will a Kindle readA: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversionQ: What It doesnt support EPUB formatA: No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called Calibre. Simple search for You Tube um0teoAR6zw and youll see a video explaining how to do this. Simples.Q: If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as wellA: No. All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device.Q: Can I save my place in the bookA: Yes. It will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position.Q: I often need reading glasses - can I adjust the font sizeA: Yes. Theres a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastesQ: Can I share books with my partner or childrenA: Yes. You can now share your books using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire familyQ. Can I use a Kindle to read in bedA. Yes. But only on the Paperwhite and Voyage models. Its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light. For the base Kindle model youll need the light onQ. Are there any free books availableA. Yes! Over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded. If you have a Amazon Prime membership you can also borrow a book from the Kindle Owners Library which includes around 60,000 books.Q: How long does the battery lastA: Depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day. Ive certainly found Ive gone for weeks without charging the deviceQ: How long does it take to chargeA: From absolutely flat, around 4 hoursQ: How many books will the Kindle holdA: Literally thousands. You can also download every book youve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited.Q: Do I need anything elseA: Youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesnt come with a charger (but the Fire does). Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. Some people also buy a cover, but I think this is not really needed. It adds to the weight, and is not really needed. It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great device and it streams better than the usual fire stick.\n",
      "Positive :-> 4th one; I lose things. Would not buy any other reader. Can read outdoors. Shuts off when I fall asleep reading. Saves page.\n",
      "Positive :-> love it, I use it for everything. sound quality is really good.\n",
      "Positive :-> Makes life easier. I have several smart home products including nest devices and hue lights. Alexa lets me control them all with my voice. And I don't even have to shout. Even if across the room.\n",
      "Positive :-> Read reviews and thought I would not want this. Price was good and the product works.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for on the go. Keep in mind that some apps are not compatible due to it being Amazon and not Android. Overall a good purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> i did not need this\n",
      "Positive :-> Good upgrade from the basic kindle that I had before.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this as a gift for my mother and she's satisfied\n",
      "Positive :-> Can play almost all songs that I request for.. Very helpful when asked about weather forecasts and news.. Great source of entertainment for me and my husband!\n",
      "Positive :-> So far it has done exactly what I want it to do. It is much faster than the fire stick\n",
      "Positive :-> I currently have it connected to my XBOX via TV in. Used mainly for Youtube, Netflix, Amazon etc. Device is easy to use and quick setup. The Alexa integration is also a great feature when I'm feeling lazy and want to speak commands into controller. If your looking for a great streaming device this is a great one to ownPro:easy setupapp store choicesability to side load appsAlexa IntegrationCon:Sometimes drops wifi connectivity forcing to restart device Apps crash (not frequent)\n",
      "Positive :-> Great picture compared to my last kindle and love the camera option\n",
      "Positive :-> I like it small lightweight easy to see wifi capabilities\n",
      "Positive :-> Don't let the 8GB prevent you from buying this Amazon tablet! Once you insert a Micro SD card, the tablet literally saves everything to the Micro SD. Be sure to get a screen protector if you plan on letting little kids play with it because the screen isn't as scratch resistant as an iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab. For Forty bucks, you just can't find a better value and with Amazon Underground, you can get a bunch of free apps which also include free in-app purchases... yup all the coins and tokens and gems and whatever else you want for free! Note that this thing comes with ads... but they only appear on the lock-screen and actually aren't that bad. They are nicely designed and don't make your lock screen look janky. Other than that, you'll want to have a PRIME membership so you can take advantage of the PRIME videos and what not. I recommend getting at least 32GB Micro SD (I believe it supports up to 128GB) to store pictures, videos, music etc... obviously get a larger capacity card if you're a download junkie.The pictures it takes are OK... good enough for viewing on a screen, but don't expect to be printing high quality pics with them.Screen quality is pretty good... not sharp and crisp like a Retina screen, but I was able to read my Kindle books just fine. The viewing angle is also decent and won't make you feel cross-eyed like some cheaper tablets out there.Battery Life is very good on this tiny tablet... something like 4-5 hours with normal use. Videos and Games will probably drain the battery faster than anything else, but it runs every game I've thrown at it so far.If you have kids, the Free-Time app is very cool... you have to pay a small subscription (like 2 bucks a month or something with PRIME) but it gives the kids access to a whole bunch of curated content, games, movies etc. just for the little ones so they don't mess with other apps or get into things your stuff.Well, that's all I can think of... this is a great little tablet of pretty good build and quality... if you're paranoid about scratches and dents get a case and screen protector and you're golden.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use and great resolution for viewing high definition content\n",
      "Positive :-> I don't know how Amazon makes any money selling these. The quality is beyond what you pay.\n",
      "Positive :-> I control everything and am having a blast. So cool\n",
      "Positive :-> Husband loves his Alexa!!! Best gift ever. Perfect\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this product,echo. Easy to use and the direction is simple to understand, I don't recommend children to use it, it's voice activated and if a child doesn't speak clearly the echo will pick up words similar to what they're trying to say and the echo may give inappropriate info based on the sound of the word. Speak clearly when using it. This is not a toy for young children.\n",
      "Positive :-> For the price tag of $59 bucks u can't go wrong....\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is great! Be sure and check out the Alexa skills!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this few months back. Its really useful which travelling. I connect to Wifi in flights and watch movies. No need to carry laptop. Its really affordable too.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nothing beats coming home and reading at night before going to sleep. Plus not having to take the extra space for each books.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my daughter, she loves it. Inexpensive, works great and she has a lot of fun with it\n",
      "Positive :-> No exterior light required. Good battery life. Easy to read at night\n",
      "Positive :-> The processor is very slow. The tablet is great for reading books and ordering stuff from Amazon, but it is really slow opening aps. Pay more to get the better processor.\n",
      "Positive :-> She is a problem sometimes but getting better and our Alexa is learning as we speak to her more more.. fun\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been using this item before and it was great I love it and I did recommend it to my friends. I love the quality, the camera and the items that the device have.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have to admit that I was quite surprised by this Amazon Fire tablet. I have been using Apple, Windows, and Android for the past few years and never gave Amazon a chance - until a Black Friday deal at Best Buy.It is responsive, visually great, and the OS is quite easy to navigate. I set this up with my younger son in mind, and the parental controls are superb. They covered everything I could think of to prevent him from doing. Amazon also has plenty of cases to choose from for their own tablets.The only thing, and this just may take time, is that I wish the app library was more extensive compared to Apple and Android. Other than that, everything else is Excellent!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have it integrated with the Philips Hue, and it only works about half of the time. The app is pretty weak, and really painful to try and play Audible books from. That said, I'm getting another one for upstairs, because it is insanely handy to be able to add items to shopping lists, todo lists, and do timers from anywhere in the house.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good tablet for very little money. Kids love it and it is very durable.\n",
      "Positive :-> The device works great as longer you have a decent Wi Fi, very handy and useful.\n",
      "Positive :-> Just as described.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this e-reader! Lightweight, easy to read screen even in very bright conditions. Very easy to check out and return library books without ever going to the library. Would recommend this product to anyone\n",
      "Positive :-> Caught a Black Friday sale and was worth every penny. Does all the essentials with a great picture for videos.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you want a Tap to make use of Amazon's Alexa voice services, then dont get one. The Tap is a fine enough Bluetooth speaker for wireless music, but the need to touch a button for voice services renders it far less valuable.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love reading on these tablets. Its so easy to use too. I would like to say that this does not use andriod software but Fire OS\n",
      "Positive :-> Present for my husband. He is enjoying trivia questions\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for my nephew for Xmas we shall see how it holds up for him\n",
      "Positive :-> Great way to kill time at the pool waiting for your tan to cook. Is easy to read in the brightest sun. Would like to have better search engine for new titles.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for beginners, nice and simple. Great price\n",
      "Positive :-> I have an iPad already. Just needed something that I can read books on. Found this on sale for $40. Great deal. Not the best for net surfing, but great for reading!\n",
      "Positive :-> My 3 yr. old loves this and is the perfect size for our needs\n",
      "Positive :-> I thought the Firestick was the way to go but the lack of buffering from the tv box is all i need to watch everything with no worry of it stopping or cutting off, if you don't have one you need to get one asap!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> We usre the echo alot in the house, even connected to our Harmony Hub and Home Automation to control the house.\n",
      "Positive :-> The hardware is good, software isn't 100% operational all the time, i.e. PlayStation Vue has had issues quite often in the month I've had it, when it loads, it's great.\n",
      "Positive :-> More positives than negatives on this one. Battery is great, readability is great. The backlight makes low light reading super. The only thing that would make this even better would be water resistance.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great little tablet for around the house . It is only WiFi capable but it is inexpensive $35.00 bfs. I use it to catch up on emails, recipes, calculator, games and so much more when I just don't feel like starting up the desk top computer. It's portable and convenient! So happy the BestBuy employee Jessica Lee suggested it, she was awesome. To think I only came in to buy a movie.\n",
      "Positive :-> Plays everything we ask. Alexa knows all the music we ask.\n",
      "Positive :-> its ok, u have to buy all the subscriptions and sometimes half of them just buffer the whole time, I have very fast internet and its wired so idk whats up with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have several devices I could read on, but I like to read outside on the deck, at the park, by the pool, etc., and I can't stand glare. The Paperwhite is perfect for reading outside. It also has a backlight feature so I can read in the car at night or in the bed without disturbing the wife. The Paperwhite is the perfect e-reader if you want something with no glare, very lightweight, and one that works seamlessly with Amazon. As a Prime member with Kindle Unlimited, my Kindle Paperwhite is my go-to reader for everything.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy setup, great sound, stylish, and fun to use!I'd love one for every room in my home!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for our 6 year old. Great parental controls allow you to keep track and monitor use. Would recommend for others to get for their children\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for streaming Netflix, Hulu, and Sling TV. It doesnt do so well for exploring the internet as it seems to be slow to load compared to other tablets. The limited memory is more than sufficient to download several movies and shows for long car rides. The battery life is also impressive.\n",
      "Negative :-> I can't return through Best Buy, because it's over 15 days. Started out ok, but then it just stopped working. It keeps freezing at home screen and I can't access anything. Extremely disappointed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use. Fun. Get news weather and music. Great addition to the household\n",
      "Positive :-> Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my kindle it makes it so much easier to read books instead of having to carry them with me\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for beginners or for anyone that wants great tablet at a great price although it's cheaper than when the original was released it still has the same greatness as it's predecessors for 1 forth of the price.\n",
      "Neutral :-> I read reviews before making a decision for my purchase, but ended up returning the device as I was expecting an experience like that of an Android tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought the tablet for my son and he loves it. very affordable and worth the money.\n",

      "Positive :-> If you're a movie nutt and want to save on cable..\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought it for reading books. And it works very well for that purpose.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great media player for the kids... video streaming is great and fun games to keep them occupied. Expand the memory with an SD card\n",
      "Positive :-> Replaced my old Kindle Fire with this White Paper. Wasn't sure if I would like it without the color screen and WiFi connection, however, with my Smartphone I really don't need those functions anymore.\n",
      "Positive :-> I updated my kindle touch to this. I loved the price. I got it a few months ago for $50, which is still an affordable price for a kindle. I love the Bluetooth and text to speech features coupled with the fact that it has an expandable drive. Those features along with the price were what I needed. Oh did I mention the resolution for watching movies is good. The camera is not the best, but I didn't get this for the camera. Matter of fact I got one on Black Friday as a Christmas gift for a friend.\n",
      "Positive :-> received earlier than expected and was very happy. Will continue to buy at Best Buy in the future\n",
      "Positive :-> I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.\n",

      "Positive :-> I was a little worried getting these since we have always had Apple but wow what a great buy. Tons of games same as iPad and Hulu and Netflix access. Thank god I grabbed these instead of iPads\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the size of the kindle. It is great to be able to put it in my purse. Also, main reason is I need to read outside sometimes and need to use sunglasses. The white paper make is real easy to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet was awesome. My kids enjoy their time on it and it is virtually indestructible. I would highly recommend this tablet for all kids not just for the tough wear and tear but also the parents security settings very good.

      "Positive :-> I cant think of enough things to ask Alexa to do for me.We are constantly listening to music from my youth (1960's).She (it) actually tells me jokes, it is like having another person in the house with you.She (it) also provides me with the current and future weather both in my area or anywhere else I might be interested in.\n",
      "Positive :-> it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments.\n",

      "Positive :-> Gave to my great nephew. 2.5 yrs old. He loves it and his father no longer has to turn over his phone to his son.\n",
      "Positive :-> I own several Amazon Echoes. I use them primarily to listen to the vast Amazon Prime Music library, which gives you access to millions of songs for a reasonable annual fee. The sound quality of the Echo is excellent, though is lacking in deep bass extension. Overall I would recommend the Amazon Echo.\n",
      "Positive :-> Oh my, I can't say enough for things about this device. I've been a loyal firestick user for one a year now, I've switched to the box back in may and it was well worth the extra 50 bucks. 80 times faster, live TV works incredibly.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my 3rd kindle and my last-i'm moving on to something better!For me -following all packaging insert guidelines-they only lasted a year at the most.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this product! I use it everyday to listen to my music, ask Alexa what time it is, and how is the weather. Some of the things it does not pick up such as some of the restaurants or places that I'm looking. I wasnt really happy about that but I'm hoping there's a software upgrade or something that will fix it. Thats the only reason i'm giving four stars rating.\n",
      "Positive :-> Loving my Christmas gift - best gift that I've received in awhile. I love the ease of downloading books and having something new to read at any given time.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have owned many tablets in the $250 and below range. This is great for the $. A bargain with lots of utility at only $50!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great overall with multipurpose functions and good sound reproduction\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tool to have when you need a quick answer for a lot\n",
      "Positive :-> Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for a great deal during Black Friday sale for my small children. I already have Amazon Prime so I get all their shows & movies streaming on the tablet. A great kids' babysitter for one-time cost of $33.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well for my purposes. Wanted a calendar and contact list so all of the other things are a bonus.\n",
      "Positive :-> Have had it for a while noe. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.\n",

      "Neutral :-> Easy to use. Intuitive to figure out most functions and operations.\n",

      "Positive :-> Everyone needs to stop reading reviews and go out and buy the Echo! I used to ask myself the most random things; what is half of 3/4, do aliens exist, and how tall is Khloe Kardashian. Well, no more awkward silences to my own questions. Alexa has been a massive help in answering my questions. Alexa has made my life so much easier and I don't even have to push any buttons. Alexa is a computer and not a human, so you have to ask Alexa questions as if you were typing it in Google BUT you have to say Alexa, followed by your question. Definitely some kinks to work out but as a GEN1 product, the Amazon Echo is awesome! Literally, stop reading this review and just purchase it!\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Echo is a very nice addition. It's kind of like Siri without the need to hold a phone. I have it paired with my WeMo switches and so far it works great!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great device and so much fun to use. It is so versatile in what it can and control.\n",
      "Positive :-> Really enjoy it. there were come questions that Alexia could not answer. I use it for music a good bit\n",
      "Positive :-> I received this as a birthday present and have really been enjoying it. Easy voice interface allow you to talk directly to the Echo to listen to news, music weather. Set up was easy with an IPhone, just follow the steps in the instructions and your off. Amazon is also creating other way to interface with the Echo through home automation. If you have one of the Logitech Harmony home Ultimate remotes with the hub then you can use voice commands through the Echo to launch activities. I really enjoy this Echo!!\n",
      "Positive :-> muy bueno\n",
      "Positive :-> This kindle replaces my older kindle. Love all it can do!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to read in daylight and optional backlight makes this a great device. I miss the side buttons of the older version and it could be easier to tap the screen with the left hand to advance the page.\n",
      "Positive :-> Was unable to get to google docs on this one even though the sales person said we would be able to. My Granddaughter needed this for school & it did not allow you to get to google docs.\n",
      "Positive :-> Does everything I wanted it to do with very few errors.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for the money. Perfect for someone who does not want to shell out hundreds for an iPad.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is great to take my Tap on the road. Easy to use and sounds great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchase echo as a gift. Owned mine for over a year and still learning from it..Planning on teaming it up with a couple of dots, great tchnology.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Fire tablet was worth every penny of the $35 price tag on Black Friday. We bought 6 of them as gifts and should've bought 6 more. I could've handed them out to a few others that were jealous. Lol\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the Amazon HD8! It is a great tablet for reading and surfing the web! It has a fast processor and amazing resolution. I would definitely purchase this product again.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got for my 4 year old. The parental controls are nice. I wish the netflix app was registered as \"video\", so I could give him 30 minutes of games and 30 minutes of video. I'm sure this works with purchased videos, maybe prime, but not netflix. He plays Star Wars Angry Birds and Star Wars Commander and loves them. It's a good size for little hands. It's great that as the parent, I can buy a book or game, and all devices can use it, even with each other if it's a multiplayer game. I bought a cheap case elsewhere that also props it up for hands-free video watching.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my red Otter Box! RTR! Protects my phone every time I drop it on the ground!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for my grandson he loves it. He is 5 and he know his way around the kindle better than I do.\n",
      "Positive :-> Really fun and informative. Questions are sometimes confusing to the device and it answers bizarrely.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it. Its fast..the visual is great. It has plenty of room to download games and books on it. I love the mayday feature on it because its helped is when we got stuck. My 3 year old can use it very easily as can my elderly parent. The processor is fast and that makes doing anything on it\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up and operate. Convenient to operate over using my smart phone. Very quick response.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Kindle Paperwhite is great. it stores plenty of books and has a screen that is easy to read. It is even easy to read outside in the sunlight. I also like how compact, light and easy it is to travel with.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon fire tv is great product. Wish the voice command option was more user friendly.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought three of these tablets. One for each of my boys. They are 5, 6, and seven years old and I have to tell Them to put these down. They would play with them all day if they could\n",
      "Positive :-> My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don't expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it'll just shut down a program or completely reboot.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a great product I enjoy the amazon fire stick\n",
      "Positive :-> What impressed me the most was the amount of free kids apps that you get with the Kindle. These are easy to use in both size and software.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet, not for the power user. Average users will find everything they need.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy and comfortable to use, almost use it every day. I would recommend this to anyone loves a book.\n",
      "Positive :-> A great way to make the web easier to use. Love it!\n",

      "Positive :-> This is great product for listening to Pandora and amazon music.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for someone as a gift and htey love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for little kids but I have a 10 year old daughter with Autism that loves this. She can watch movies, play games, and READ her favorite books.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excelent for reading, and for the kids. Own two of these, and they both work perfectly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great little tablet. Inexpensive so easy for taking with you without worry.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Kindle Fire is great for Amazon shopping. It offers games, music, movies and more that only the Kindle Fire, with Amazon, can offer. It truely meets a 4 star rating from me. The Kindle Fire has a very competitive price when considering other devices.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love that you can pick different colors for the tablet, my mom will love it. Great easy functionality and ability to delete apps and install new ones.\n",

      "Positive :-> I'd recommend this to everyone. Even if you have no computer knowledge, you can be a expert\n",
      "Positive :-> I have bought many of this during chrismas time and its a good tablet for a ages,\n",
      "Positive :-> Limit kids usage of electronics by time but still allow them to play. A must buy for kids\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it. Great product that I would recommend to all.\n",
      "Positive :-> Absolutely love the Amazon Echo!! Had one for our FL home & had to buy another for our NY home. Love the GREAT sound & the ease of playing music or listening to talk shows.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet give you the opportunity of everything, surf the web, email, music, games, etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good product. Very useful in mamy scenarios..\n",
      "Positive :-> So I've been wanting a fire since they originally came out read some questionable review's about kindle basic stuff nothing seemed to really discourage me you really don't know what your experience will be unless you try so I got it and began the prime \"free trial \" I was shocked to wake up this morning to find out I had been charged $107.00 for a full year of prime one day before my trial was supposed to end no email no contact no are you interested they just charged my card without warning imaginably upset with Amazon. the tablet it self is so so and is slightly basic the front facing camera is slightly better then the outwards one the Alexa feature is kinda nice and fun to talk to it also sync's to other echo devices as well if buying for a teenager or any young adult do set parental controls and or passwords to keep from unauthorized perchues I think the tablet is OK but no great but because of my recent experience I rated it it 2 stars your ultimately going to make up your own mind and decided if your going to purchase this device and decide if its right for you good luck in your decision\n",
      "Positive :-> Great value for what I needed. Just using it to receive email ordersfrom Grub Hub for my restaurant\n",
      "Positive :-> This Tablet is awesome and so Powerful and easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa has become part of the family and her ability to interact is awesome!\n",
      "Positive :-> I belive this tab is one of the best low priced tab on the market. There are a lot of free apps and the screen resolution is supurb I would recomond this tab highly!\n",
      "Negative :-> I bought this Fire TV 3 months ago. One day, out of the blue, it stopped working. Power is on but as soon after I see the Amazon logo the screen goes black. I google the problem and it seems that the only way to reset it to the factory mode is by the on screen menu so there is no way for me to do it. I just emailed the company and waiting for a response since it is unacceptable that this thing only lasted 3 months before it became useless. Not a happy camper here!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have enjoyed many features this tablet has to offer.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Battery wouldnt hold a charge but was able to get it teplaced.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product, I have Apple TV 3, and this is just as good or better.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it's perfect for him!\n",
      "Positive :-> great for first timers with technology...alexa is very smart. we not need our collectible cds anymore\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon fire is almost relevant to a tablet, which holds ,post of the feature and respect to processor speed it more than the expectation to surf and listen music\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for ppl that use Amazon and Amazon products. The price was great to.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good screen resolution. Keep wifi off and adjust brightness for best battery life.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product the entire family enjoys it. Works without any problems.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up Plays movies from Amazon Prime with no problem Great tablet for the price\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is fun, a bit biased to amazon product. Example: when I scream at her to play a song she will play it from amazon music and not my Spotify unless I instruct her to. Which isn't terrible, but just a heads up. She is way quicker than your phone for finding answers to things, but the algorithm to get exactly what you're looking for is still being worked on. So don't expect her to always find the right answer. She's still a great product and fun.\n",
      "Positive :-> These is so much this unit can do......I do recommend this one over the fire stick (I have both) only because of the buffering issues. Didn't really notice a difference between the wifi and Ethernet cord plugged in\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my Grandparents for Christmas and loaded games for them they love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> We love our Alexa! Mainly used to set timers, alarms, and listening to music. We've had four months and no major complaints. Amazon updating new commands often! Only reason 4 stars is the ability to pick up voices. We have to be rather close for Alexa to respond to us. My 5 year old son literally has to be right next to her for Alexa to pick up in his commands. Other than that works great and fun!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my new Kindle since they no longer come with chargers. It's fast and can be used for my phone.\n",
      "Positive :-> My great granddaughter loves it. Easy to use and it holds the charge well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my mother to review pictures and play game. She is enjoying it since games can be played without Wi-Fi.\n",
      "Positive :-> Slower that my iPad. Love it. Cheaper and better than my Kindle Paperwhite with much more storage. Also bought 128 micro SD card. Prime member and use it to download free with prime movies\n",
      "Positive :-> this is a great buy i first bought the fire stick did not like due to fact it was slower less memory and kept on overheating. the fire tv is way faster more memory and never over heats\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought these for my kids worth every penny!! With the micro Sd slot I was able to fill it with movie upon movie for a 1000 mile road trip, these were a god send for the kids\n",
      "Positive :-> My parents love their new Kindle Fire HD's!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> THIS FIRE BOX IS A GOOD STREAMING DEVICE. Would recommend this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is definitely the Rolls Royce of the e-readers love all the new features that it has. Upgraded from the paperwhite to the voyage.\n",
      "Positive :-> After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That's where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees.\n",
      "Positive :-> i really like my fire it has a nice picture and is easy to operate\n",
      "Positive :-> Have to have to charge the book.\n",
      "Positive :-> Set up was really easy. It has been really fun to play with. I have enjoyed the emails that come giving tips about different commands and fun things it will do.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent purchase, satisfied my needs for entertaining television!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my Echo, cant wait to learn how many things she does! LOTS OF FUN\n",
      "Positive :-> She Loves the white background. She is very Happy with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was actually an impulse purchase, I was out for the weekend and forgot my Kindle so I picked up one of these. It works so much better than you'd expect from a budget tablet, the screen is very responsive to touch and has good color reproduction. Unless your looking at the screen from just a couple inches away the pixels aren't overly distracting and the text is reasonably sharp.This is a device you can carry around and not be too upset if it gets lost or damaged, and it's a good e-reader (and cheaper than the e-paper models, oddly enough.)\n",
      "Positive :-> My Kindle is great for reading books. It's less useful for use on reference material where I'm frequently moving from one part of the work to another.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loves her kindle. She enjoys being able to watch youtube and Netflix. It's a perfect size for her.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my daughter as a replacement from a broken tablet it's very easy to use for my child\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my girlfriends daughter, she can access Facebook, Netflix and many more apps now.. Nice convenient size. Good deal!\n",
      "Positive :-> It is easy to set up, efficient in voice commands and entertaining.\n",

      "Positive :-> good Quality\n",
      "Positive :-> Granddaughter loves it. She plays on it daily and downloads the games with no problem\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet is very functional and it is offered at a great price. It had everything I was looking for in a tablet. I am very pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter can never put her fire tablet down she really loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product works amazing . Works awesome from home .\n",
      "Positive :-> Upgrades from fire stick. Works good but I really don't see the difference between the stick. I guess a little faster and less buffering\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this on sale and definitely a good purchase. Very useful for the whole family\n",
      "Positive :-> It's only cost 50 dollars and it's very good for day to day usage .. the only little thing I experienced it's a bit slow sometimes..\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the most amazing thing!What can't it do? Say a command and instantly you'll get it. Incredible!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Picture is top-notch...4K capable. Also, something I discovered on my own that the \"experts\" in the stores did not know or tell me: even though you don't have a 4K capable TV, the Fire Box may still be what you want instead of the Fire Stick...here's why: when you watch live news or sports they are broadcast at 30 frames per second. The Fire Stick only can produce 20 frames per second, so the picture looks somehow \"previously recorded\"...jusy not like a sharp, high-def pucture. So I replaced the Fire Stick on my 1080p capable TV with the Fire Box and, BINGO!, perfect...because it can reproduce 30 frames per second! You'll see the difference, trust me!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> One of the best invention ever! I love mine and giving as presents for Xmas!\n",
      "Positive :-> My 6 year old got one last year and it's very good\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm amazed at how easy it is to use and how useful it is. I would recommend this product\n",
      "Positive :-> Really nice customer first service. I have had other Kindle readers before so was familiar with the unit.\n",
      "Positive :-> This box will replace cable, food and water. If it didn���t need power, I���d live for free!\n",
      "Positive :-> An easy way to read your favorite books!Whether you're in the sun or in the dark, this is the best Kindle ever.The only thing I don't like is the 'flash' when you turn the page.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a present for my father and he hasn't complained one bit about it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great for everyday use. The family loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> It was awesome kids love it, this is simply amazing\n",
      "Positive :-> I had ordered the Echo and from what I had read I did not think I would need the Remote. The Echo works great if you are in the same Room. I like to listen to Music while I am cooking, cleaning, or doing nothing. I always had to go back in the same room to where my Echo was to change or skip to the next Song if I wanted. With the Remote I can change it from any room. I just stick it in my Pocket and take it out when I want to switch, turn it down or up. Connects through Blue Tooth very quickly. Has a magnetic holder to keep the Remote on (mine is on my Desk Leg) to keep it when not in use. There is a Felt Pad on the back of the Magnetic Holder so that it will not scratch any surface that it is attached to. I love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best streaming device to watch movies on or even Netflix.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great, has a great display, easy to use. Rivals other more expensive brands.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice and compact. Short time to charge. Good product.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. Got it for $33..couldn't beat the price. We found this was a greal alternative to pricier tablets and clunkier items such as laptops and Chromebooks, when all you wanted to to is check email or do surfing. Display is great, Definitely recommend\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves it !Never had this when I was his age\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a very good tablet to have for reading or playing games.\n",
      "Positive :-> Something the family always wanted. Got it as a gift for my wife. Works good. But occasionally pick up conversations. Not to thrilled about that.\n",
      "Positive :-> this product is very nice. I bought it as a birthday present and the person loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> easy to use. looks good. The prize winner was very pleased.\n",

      "Positive :-> Converts any TV into a smart TV. Added Kodi to mine and works great.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is great for the price. We ended up purchasing 6 of them. It is great for the kids and is very functional. I think the price helped lower my stress level where the kids are concerned, but it is very sturdy. Would purchase again.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to use for streaming services and it works great\n",
      "Positive :-> Love using Alexa for music and syncing her with Hue to run the lights, but don't like how specific you must be with the way you ask her. Sometimes just can't get the answer cause she wants to be asked in a different way.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kid love it, especially the sd card slot.Tgey can watch there favorite movies on the microsd.\n",
      "Positive :-> I didn't like that this model came with a USB cable but not a plug. Other than that, it met my expectations. Synching the new device with my existing Kindle account was easy. And my initial fear that the touchscreen would collect fingerprints and dirt hasn't been a problem so far.\n",
      "Negative :-> Don't waste money on the kid program friendly ones that's what Locks are for\n",
      "Positive :-> It doesnt get any better than this for a travel tablet, or for kids. The size is perfect and function is seemless with prime. Excellent product.\n",
      "Positive :-> The picture looks better running netflix on this than apple tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use, lots of features, keeps kids interested, good beginner tablet unit\n",
      "Positive :-> Good starter product for someone. If you use this a lot, the 8G is not big enough.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love reading on my Kindle. So many book selections.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the tablet . It is vary good for reader who likes to read .my kids read books on it alot.\n",

      "Positive :-> Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM.\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought these tablets for our children ages 5 through 10 for gameplay so they could stay off of my Samsung tablet. Hallelujah! They absolutely love them! The only problem that I have with tablet is the length of the cord on the charger. It's too short. If you want to continue play while it's charging, you have to literally sit right next to the electrical source. We remedied this problem by exchanging the cord for a longer one that we had around the house.\n",
      "Positive :-> This thing is amazing. The voice recognition is awesome and it does an excellent job picking up my voice even when playing music. Its integration into my smart home was flawless and adds a whole new level to my home.\n",
      "Positive :-> the item is good but keep frozen I need some advice\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to setup but doesn't do everything without additional products. Better than google home.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love using this. So easy to download and find books, so easy to store, the battery life is amazing. It's like reading a book without the hassle of the space, being able to look up words while reading it amazing. The only thing I wish is that I had gotten one sooner!\n",
      "Positive :-> Really like reading a paper. My eyes feel good. I put many books inside and easy to read. Like it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have Amazon Prime and this makes it so easy to watch movies or tv shows. HULU, Netflix and many other ways to watch what you want when you want to watch it. I am now ready to cut the cable.\n",
      "Positive :-> Our kids ranging from 4-12 like this product. It's very versatile for all ages\n",
      "Positive :-> So the only complaint I could see most people had was that the battery life was poor compared to previous/non-backlit versions. I will say that is true, however, with about an hour to 30 minutes of reading, I can go a few weeks between charges. I feel that is very reasonable.As with the Kindle e-readers, I have had very good luck with them. They are well built, devices and very easy on the eyes. The device has a good texture and does not feel like it will slip out of your hand while reading.Overall I'm very happy with my new Kindle. Its so much easier on the eyes! Worth every penny!\n",
      "Positive :-> great if you want to read, watch a show, catch up on email, or casually browse the internet.\n",

      "Positive :-> I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had the kindle keyboard before and got the paper white for Christmas and really like. I can read I any light I no longer have to have a light attached to my kindle to read before bed. Pretty simple to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works really well. easy to use and easy to download from amazon prime account and other apps\n",
      "Positive :-> Very cool device in general, and becomes even more convenient with every smart device you add to this system. I think the Google Home is smarter, but it's cooler to say, \"Alexa...\" vs. \"Ok/Hey Google...\"\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for the internet... ....Saves my phone battery\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this device. I love learning all the stuff it can do and I look forward learning what Amazon is going to do to improve it in the future.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the ease of setup and the apps available in fire tv.\n",

      "Positive :-> Really good small tablet. Small and very convenient. Great visual quality.\n",
      "Positive :-> picked up this fire tablet for the simple reason of reading ebooks purchased through kindle rather than on my phone. it's small enough I can stash it in my bag and easy on the wallet if anything happens to it. go ahead and pick up a case for it and maybe a glass screen protector for added piece of mind\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the fire for my father for Christmas. The is his first tablet and I was afraid he would not use it. He has not put it down and it could not be more user friendly! I would recommend to anyone looking for a low cost tablet!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to start using and a fun approach to choosing the right program to watch. I am enjoying sharing with friends.\n",
      "Positive :-> But the youtube app has so many ads it has the kids on all kinds of stuff.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is amazing. I am electronically challenged, but can use this item, maybe not to its fullest potential, but I am learning!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I had previously purchased one for our family and when they went on sale I purchased one for my daughter. Everyday I find something new to use it for.\n",
      "Neutral :-> I bought this tablet because of the price and the specs seemed fine but it is slow it freezes and crashes I dont think it was a good buy\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased for my granddaughter and it was a great investment.\n",
      "Positive :-> Does the job. Kids are kinda of rough with its holding up well.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for my husband for him to use a home. He likes that he can sit anywhere and use it. He has a big laptop and does not transport well. He said he did not want a tablet, but he uses everyday. The only downfall on this tablet is that when you turn it on it advertises some online game and you have to wait for it to go away before you can use it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for a Christmas gift for a friend. She loves it! No issues with product, software or quality.\n",
      "Positive :-> Like the tablet but didn't realize you had to put up with the ads. Also don't like how Amazon blocks a lot of apps. You can get around that though.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best divine for streaming movies and tv show. The wifi and processor are fast.\n",
      "Positive :-> Can't beat the price.a great Christmas gift for adults and teens.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price - great shipping - great item! Perfect Christmas gift for our granddaughter!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this Echo Alexa. Gives me weather, news, appointments, unlimited music of Amy type & a thousand other things. Everyone needs Alexa!!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been using Kindle for several years now but my old one was starting to freeze and had problems connecting to the internet sometimes. This new one is a great replacement.

      "Positive :-> Very fast response to the different apps and looks great with my 4K tv\n",
      "Positive :-> I love how compact this kindle is, I'm able to put it in my gym bag, backpack, and my purse. The screen is a plain white which is great for reading because you don't get a glare, I just wish Best Buy offered a case for it I had to purchase one from amazon.\n",
      "Positive :-> So this is my second fire tv and just like my first one I love this one just as much. My advice is you are debating between the fire stick or the fire tv pay the extra money and get the fire tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had a kindle for about 4 years, I've been wanting a fire hd for sometimes, because of all the features. I can honestly say that I love my fire hd.\n",
      "Positive :-> The automatic light adjustment is pretty cool, but I find myself accidentally covering the sensor which really throws it off.I like being able to press the buttons on either side instead of touching the screen. I also appreciate the flat surface, it doesn't seem to attract as much dust in the corners like my other kindles.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice for watch nexflix play games best item i buy .\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the kindle Fire for my Uncle. He has really enjoyed this product. Easy to operate, variety of games and books. Also, this model has a camera!\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome tablet it's fast and easy to use. Affordable can't find any better at this price\n",

      "Positive :-> works great in bright sunlight, used it at the beach\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text.\n",
      "Positive :-> great speaker and alexa is awesome. works seamless with phone and with amazon service. directional mic is great\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a well made box, perfect. It uses android so there is almost nothing you can't do with it\n",
      "Positive :-> The sound in this is on par with other high end portable speakers. That however is really just the tip of the iceberg. If you have amazon prime you can access all your music just by asking. Also this works if you have Phillips hue so you can turn the lights off and on with your voice.\n",
      "Positive :-> Finally I can read at the beach and it's super light!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the echo!!! We use it for weather, pandora, an alarm amongst other things. We plan to purchase others!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great deal for a handy tablet. I have no complaints.\n",
      "Positive :-> Gift for mom. didn't know if she would use it. Seems to be useful and makes it easy for her to listen to music. Also helps with weather, jokes tend to be corny. Hasn't used it to order anything. Got one for other family members and they seem to use it too.\n",
      "Positive :-> This charger and adapter works just fine with the E-reader. I was so glad that I purchased it as the E-reader does not come with one.\n",
      "Positive :-> Had trouble setting it up. Set it up using app on wife's phone. It doesn't work when wife's phone is out of the house. Grandkids have fun with it. Music speakers are good. I have a lot to learn about this thing.\n",
      "Positive :-> Meets expectations consistent with the price. I don't really use it for anything. It simply can't replace my iPad. Both the screen quality and battery life are poor relative to my iPad 4 from a few years ago, so I haven't found a use for this Kindle Fire. Generally it just feels cheap and the user interface not as clean as the iPad. I think it's value is consistent with the low price point.\n",
      "Positive :-> cool tablet that you can use daily, just freezes a bit, but the reset button works well.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon fire is a great tablet. U cannot beat the price. Works as good as other way more expensive tablets\n",

      "Positive :-> BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDKIDS AGES 5-10 AND THEY LOVED IT\n",
      "Positive :-> I really enjoy my kindle. My only issue with it is that I can't get some of the apps I normally use however it does have most of them.\n",
      "Positive :-> It was a gift for my grandson . It is a great gift idea at a good price\n",
      "Positive :-> I mainly used this device to control some home automation items in the house and to watch quick youtube videos. For its price, it is a great device, do not expect it to be the greatest tablet out there.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the voice control music and personal assistant that Alexa provides through this product. My son just loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo does everything. I love it. They add new apps often. :)\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product and excited to use it bought some for our kids\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for what I need to use it for movies etc great for a gift\n",
      "Positive :-> In an effort to cut the cord we purchased the Amazon Fire TV. It has all the apps we needed: Vue, Hulu, Netflix, Prime (obviously) as well as HBO, Showtime and the network TV station apps. It's easy to navigate and with a little setup we're cable free! Would totally recommend.\n",

Easy set up, does all SORTS of fun things....My favorite is being able to wake up in the middle of the night and say \"Alexa, add orange juice to my shopping list\" and go right back to sleep.\n",
      "Positive :-> These are the best you can get! I have bought 2 already\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughters first tab,I love that it has protected case and parental controls my son will be jealous because it has more memory than his\n",

      "Positive :-> I bought these tablets for my niece and nephew who are only 2 and 3 and they love it. My niece who's only 3 has shown my mother a few things. Great products\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a very convenient tool for me to read books, now it saves me a lot of storage of books\n",
      "Positive :-> Still learning to use it. I wish it was compatible with Sirius XM radio .There are so many skills to enable.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for my wife after she had seen one at a friends house. She loves it! It stays in the kitchen and she listens to music, sets cooking timers, gets weather reports and overall just enjoys it. It works flawlessly and is great entertainment for our grandson too!

      "Positive :-> Lovely upgrade for my sister from an old iPad gen.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids love it and use it for everything, including their homework. It is really a great companion.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Purchased for viewing Amazon prime. Loaded a couple apps and set it to sleep. When I returned a few hours later it was stuck in a perpetual boot and was not recoverable. I will get another as I like the features and price point, just a little soured by this first impression. I'm checking that I would not recommend to a friend but am hoping this will change with the second one. to be continued...\n",
      "Positive :-> The experience of reading on this device is not the same, you should try. Quality is awesome and light adjustment as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my daughter. She loves it! She uses it much more than her iPad for reading it's easier on the eyes.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the box sometimes it glitches out but it's really easy to troubleshoot.\n",

      "Positive :-> I purchased this Echo as a gift for my husband and he loves it! He likes having his random questions answered immediately and we're now looking into purchasing other items that work with Alexa.\n",
      "Positive :-> I never thought i would need this having siri, but siri can't tie alexas shoe laces. I have her tied into my home automation system and its amazing.

      "Positive :-> This is one of the best products I use in such a long time not only you could watch live television and movies you can catch up with the shows do you like both international and domestic\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great kindle for kids to use as it is very user friendly and once they get the hang of it they will not put it down.\n",
      "Positive :-> This reader is a gift to my daughter for Christmas. She said that it works great at the beach!\n",

      "Positive :-> This is my first tablet and I'm excited about learning how to use it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Needed to replace the old Nook. Looked at the fire and was a little unsure. At this price though you get more than what you pay for. I travel alot for work and this has earned it's place in my travel bag. Well most of the time it's actually in my back pocket so I have quick access to it to get some reading done. For anything to be carried on my person during travel is high praise from me because that means it has value and importance.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really like it. Easy to use and very friendly. L\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it! Alexia is at your service. Love the ability to play a variety of music. Great product!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my wife as a gift and she and the rest of the family love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this\n",
      "Positive :-> I use a Kindle Paper White for all my reading. 2 hours plus a day. But I am always disappointed when it comes to looking at maps, pictures and diagrams. Although the battery life is much shorter than the reader and the screen is not glare free, the picture is great for these old eyes!\n",
      "Positive :-> We were looking for a good tablet at an affordable price. This one has definitely met our expectations and we hope to use it for a long time!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this on super sale as an e-reader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. I found it to be a great value for the price. It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn't bother with that function. All in all a terrific buy for the money, but don't expect an iPad.\n",
      "Positive :-> I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for.\n",

      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet plus you can't beat this price.\n",
      "Positive :-> It began with one, now I have three. I need two more, but I think I will get dots. I want t try hooking it up to my Darth Vader Bluetooth helmet. That's going to be sweet. I wonder if I can rename this from Alexa to Darth? Get this, but realize you'll want many more.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product, and works flawlessly with home automation. At first I was a huge skeptic about needing an always on device. However after buying an echo earlier this year from amazon, I have become an avid user. So much so that I bought a second one from best buy once they began carrying them! Also per-ordered their amazon dot, which is $49. Order one now, you will not be disappointed!\n",
      "Positive :-> If you like movies it's worth it. Had to have a friend help us set it up but it works great\n",
      "Positive :-> It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn't have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my third kindle. I love the built in light. My first was bitten by my sister's dog (leather case) and my second wore out. I also like that I can use the Kindle app on any device and pick up where I left off.\n",
      "Positive :-> Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook\n",

      "Positive :-> I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really like the tablet. It was easy to set up everything on it. The only complaint is that it is a bit slow. I love that I can add storage to it when needed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product. I Upgraded to the Fire HD 10 10.1\n",
      "Positive :-> First day of purchase it overheats. Defective product.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am not a tv person but I like the movies and tv content. I love pureflix\n",
      "Positive :-> The Good:Great for music playing, and lighting control if you've bought Hue lights, or smart switches. I have the WeMo switches and they work pretty wellGreat for some control of Amazon's Fire stick TV.OK at answering general questions, but not amazing. Alexa is often stumped...Still... its's pretty cool to speak, and have your house react around you...\n",
      "Negative :-> Bought it for my 5 yr old daughter and for some reason it did not work. This is the second time I've purchased this and had to return it. So I will get her a mini iPad. Never again will I waste my time and money.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was using Nook glow light, migrating to paper white has been the bestKindle store provides plenty of books compared to nookBattery life is excellent , will last 2-3 weeks without recharging with daily use of 2 hours\n",
      "Positive :-> gets the jib done. makes for a good tablet for the kids to play on\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is sturdy and great for my kids with games and learning.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my granddaughter so she could have it to watch movies and play games. She loves it and takes it everywhere she goes. It is way better than a leap pad and it can grow with her.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have bought 3 of the amazon fire tv boxes. I love how many online services you can access via the fire. I would rate this a perfect 5 if it was not for the fact that the fire remote is so poorly made. 2 of the 3 remotes died before the batteries did. Sure you can use your phone to control the fire tv box but that is slow and should not have to be done. And dont try to get help from Amazon their idea of help is to have you buy a new fire tv box.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for downloading books & movies. It also takes pictures as well as surfing the web. All in all very satisfied with purchase\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect size, so easy to carry around. Long lasting battery life. Would reccomend!\n",
      "Positive :-> Having a backlight makes this the better choice. Plus the lighting is adjustable for brightness.\n",
      "Positive :-> Expectations exceeded on this. Works great. Very happy with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Upgraded from an older model AppleTV to this, couldnt be happier with the amount of features and apps available. Voice search is surprisingly great!\n",
      "Positive :-> Like having an assistant. Use it to multi task while I'm at home and work.\n",
      "Positive :-> I wanted a different gadget with a unique featured searchshopp and reading capacity.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am very happy with my purchase. The echo has been used every day since it has been in my home.\n",

      "Positive :-> Great choice, battery life outstanding, many kid friendly features.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for myself on black Friday. I have had 2 Kindles before but never the Fire. Love it!\n",

      "Positive :-> Very pleased experience installation and setup....\n",
      "Positive :-> This product is really good.. this product does everything it says.... you can watch hull,Netflix,penthouse,hustlers, Showtime,HBO,you tube the streaming is unlimited.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this thing!!!!!So much better then my nook.\n",
      "Positive :-> Super and funIs work in my xbox one sMy light insteon\n",
      "Positive :-> Great buy. Bought it for my 10 year old niece. She loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great Tablet for a low price, it has a lot of bloatware but still worth it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product for the price. Larger screen , light weight. Easy to download apps\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good all around tablet for a nice price. I have one for me and one for my seven year old and haven't regretted it. I suggest it if you have Prime and love tech.Only con is the cameras which are a bit grainy but I use a phone for pics\n",
      "Positive :-> No reason to shop around at this price there is something for everybody I bought 3 at black friday price for gifts no complants!\n",
      "Positive :-> I started out crazy hesitant about the product seeming skeptical of the voice recognition being overdramatized. It hears me while a song is very loud. As well as the information pre-downloaded is awesome. Just for music alone it's awesome. Everything else, which is not able to be explained is far beyond worth the money. It's an underpriced item and I plan to buy 1 more.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my kindle fire it's is good for watching movies reading and anything you need a tablet for.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Tap is a great device. The device has very good audio quality despite it's small size. The biggest difference between this and the larger Amazon Echo, is that you have to press the \"microphone\" button before the device will listen to you (which is great for people who are concerned that the Echo is always listening to what you say). So far, the battery life has been great. With the Alexa app, it is very easy to connect this device to different Wi-Fi networks.\n",
      "Positive :-> This e-reader is amazing. It is so light and easy to read with one hand. The screen is great and the battery lasts for weeks.\n",
      "Positive :-> so far so good,,,, wife very happy. misses her old one....\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this fire for my friend who wants to buy kindle..this serves both Kindle and Tab... very nice and very cheap..worth for what i paid.. I highly recommend this for beginners\n",
      "Positive :-> excellent product I would buy all mu grand kids one\n",
      "Positive :-> The Video quality on this is lacking compared to other streaming devices. In the plus side you can use kodi. I would get a roku if you don't plan on using kodI or a nividi shield if you plan on using kodi.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you have amazon prime this is simply another way gaining more content If you are a cable cutter.. There's also the added plus of adding xbmc and getting additional content for content free.\n",
      "Positive :-> The light and white page allows me to read in bed without disturbing my spouse.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this tablet bought this for my granddaughter she enjoys it and plays with it daily\n",
      "Positive :-> Small enough to fit into a small bag. Wonderful to use to pass the time when waiting for transportations and appointments and the paperwhite can be used in low level lighting. It is easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very basic. If you need more than the basics, look for an Android tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product would recommend to buy it to family and friends.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent speakers and great voice control... I'm very happy with my alexia\n",
      "Positive :-> Goog tablet the only bad part is that you have to be creating a profile and thats where it gets complicated because when they sell u the tablet they saw its for kids\n",
      "Positive :-> Next release includes Alexa the famous personal assistant - so add to all the features and great value on this generation and another price drop as well!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Don't shop around! Great parental controls. Easy to set up\n",
      "Positive :-> At first, the fire box was great. After two months the remote stopped working. I'd say save some money and just get the fire sticks. I have two of them and no problem. The fire tv box has been nothing but issues.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet works well for anyone. It however does have a few quirks. When trying to read an article it will just out of the blue send you somewhere else. But other than that it's fast & very clear & bright screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is working very well so far.\n",
      "Positive :-> She doesn't always understands me but I still like it\n",
      "Positive :-> It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this! Always messing around and asking it questions\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a really good thing to have a round the house\n",
      "Positive :-> I wanted the charger block with the folding power tines, but not available so I got this one and it works very well and I like it as much as the other type.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my grand niece, she loves it. Can't beat it for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Tablet is awesome. Easy to set up and navigate.Compact. Easy to hold.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product... easy to use! Compatible with everything I want to use it for.\n",
      "Positive :-> My granddaughter enjoy being able to download her games and music and it's real easy for her being 8 years pld.\n",
      "Positive :-> I didn't take the time to read the reviews on this as I actually went to the store to buy a Fire stick. The salesman talked me into the Fire tv instead supposedly because of higher picture quality. I haven't noticed any differences. For an average user, maybe the stick is just fine and you save money.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home.\n",
      "Positive :-> There is so much to do with the Echo, that I am still getting to know it. Everyday, I learn and try a new skill. Great device, great price!\n",
      "Positive :-> Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it!\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids really enjoy the alexa. I will buy more of these in the future\n",
      "Positive :-> We picked these up to help people register to vote at events. They have proven to be durable with a respectable battery life and enough compute power to do the work without lag and annoyance. The size is perfect for voter registration drives or other community out reach.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was looking from long time and good deal found on best buy!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this reader for a trip I was planning. I must say, it is awesome! The size is just perfect to throw in a backpack and the resolution is very good for this pricepoint. You can't go wrong purchasing this!\n",
      "Neutral :-> I like it. However, when reading the page number is not shown. Also unable to use the dictionary. Still in the 'new' stage.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my wife as a birthday gift. She has really enjoyed it. It is easy on her eyes, light weight, and keeps a god charge. It is easy to use, but she does already have experience using the original Kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> everything is cool with Echo but the sound quality can be made better for sure. Also there needs to be way to equalize volume as needed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Your mileage may vary, but... I picked up both the Google Home and the Amazon Echo because I wanted to see which one was best. Oddly, Amazon Echo pairs better with my work accounts (GSuite/Google Apps for Biz) because Google Home doesn't do that yet. For home automation, Echo can't be beat. For playing podcasts, Echo is on top of it. For answering questions, Google Home allows me to get to my answer a lot faster with better sources. In terms of audio quality, Echo is top dog. Can it hear you from across the room? Yeah, in fact - mine can hear me from outside my office 3 rooms away.Has it changed my routines? Yep. I love the Flash Briefing. The skills, for now, are mostly useless or \"add-ons\" to the Flash Briefing. It can read your audio books and Kindle books (and they do a freebie monthly) - but as I listen at 3x speed to most of my audio books, it's not the most helpful thing ever (because there's no speed control yet).Is it the Computer from the Enterprise? Not yet. It can't perform complex tasks like, \"Alexa, find me a 4 or 5-star Chinese Restaurant nearby and make a reservation\", cannot call out (hey Skype, where are you?), and cannot send text messages or write emails.There's some connecting the dots that will have to happen for this to be life-changing, but for now, it's pretty good.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa, write the review please. Well, not quite that good yet, but it is a lot of fun and makes life more hands free which also means it is easier to multitask.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Kindle has a decent screen and image quality. The feature I miss most is the lack of capability of this tablet to automatically shut down when you close the case - but understandable at the price point.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a really great item for a really great price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Don't like the fact you have to have Amazon prime to use it\n",
      "Positive :-> My Grandchildren Love Their Tablets! They really really enjoy watching movies & playing games on their tablets.\n",
      "Positive :-> Hard to argue with an amazon fire tv or stick. I bought this to replace my previous one that only did 1080p. Having had both I would say you won't go wrong with either. I bought the firetv for the direct Internet plug in capability which I figured would be a concern with wifi\n",
      "Positive :-> I use this device for streaming live tv with no issues.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7\". I don't try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro!\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought to replace broken Kindle screen. Cheaper to buy new then replace screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa has very good voice recognition. It has new tools added every day\n",
      "Positive :-> Needed a tablet for games and apps for the elderly. Great choice\n",
      "Positive :-> Fun apps for kids along with some great educational apps and videos\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet is good for a child between the ages of 5-18. Great purchase!\n",
      "Positive :-> Was a christmas gift for my daughter she loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Only downfall is there are lots of pop up ads, otherwise a great inexpensive tablet!\n",
      "Positive :-> Shipped fast. Easy setup. Works great. Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kids will love this tablet, has a camera and kids can make movies with it. Wonderful for a child with a good imagination\n",
      "Positive :-> I have 2 grandsons that have been wanting a tablet, so on Christmas Day they are going to be so happy!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have to admit I actually like this thing. I wish it would browse things on the internet a little more but oh well\n",
      "Positive :-> VERY HAPPY WITH STREAMING CHOICE. THE FIRESTICK TV\n",
      "Positive :-> Young readers don't have to keep up with a book. The tablet is good for young readers\n",
      "Positive :-> Our 4 year old granddaughter loves playing the games on the tablet. There is a great variety for her to choose from. She also loves taking pictures with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Many features this tablet has and is a great price!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet!!! I absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! I would buy it again!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought the echo a month or so ago, so far love the ability to ask questions and get answers. Will likely be purchasing another, or a dot for my mother as she loves it as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent purchase and easy to set up. Great entertainment console.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the second Amazon Fire TV device I have purchased, which I bought as an addition for another TV in my home. This device is great because it allows you to connect to so many different TV source (Amazon Prime, Netflix, Sling TV, etc.). Also, the processing speed with this device is great and a little better than the firestick that I have.\n",
      "Negative :-> Logging in with a password can be difficult since the typed lettersare not shown, even temporarily, so inadvertent typos require guesswork to find.Signing out of e-mail is not clear, if it can be done.Some \"free\" downloads fail because of lack of payment.Allowing for my lack of skills. I was hoping for a little more.It was OK fort basic stuff.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically \"tap\" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this item and it's easy to use. I bought 2 of this already. Great gift also for your love ones.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but its great for entertainment.\n",
      "Positive :-> Does what it's supposed to. Fine for reading or watching video. But I was anticipating it having a swype keyboard (my earlier gen kindle has one) and it doesn't. Ended up having to buy a a Bluetooth keyboard so I can use it to type notes at work.\n",
      "Positive :-> So this is more than just another electronic gadget. First the sound from the echo is way above average, not Sono's but not far off. Second is the ability you will have to make your home a \"smart\" home. Echo will be able to control your lights, plugs, thermostat, garage door, sprinkler system etc. some of the random features are fun like \" tell me a joke\" or sing happy birthday or what is the weather like in DubaiWell worth the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> I also have a fire and like it's overall performance.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my mother who isn't very tech savvy as I needed to get her something to get use to touch screens and smart devices. Its fairly user friendly and she is doing well with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo is a good product, at a reasonable price; we use it everyday.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 4 yr old is fully capable of navigating to her favorite games, videos, photos, etc. I like the bumper case too. It has proved its worth already.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well and great for travel. Small and portable\n",
      "Positive :-> He loves his new tablet lots of fun and educational games to choose from and best of all very kid proof he has dropped it numerous times and I see no signs of damage whatsoever\n",
      "Positive :-> I've started to allow this device to grow on me. Yes I saw some color variation but either my eyes have adjusted or it's gone away. I'm back to reading like I used to and love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> I know there are other options out there, including the Fire Stick but this box is great. Doesn't lag at all, unlike my Apple TV (last generation though). I wanted to have a product based on Android for the goodies available and so far I'm liking it a lot, and it's 4K :)\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my first fire and I love it! It is perfect for taking my books on the go without having the large bulky books!\n",
      "Positive :-> a birthday gift for my son and he likes it. always attached to his hand and always on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> For $50 the kindle fire 7 is a bargain. I had the original kindle and the difference in functionality is night and day. The only minus is amazon prime is now $99 a year and it's hard to justify that unless you shop amazon alot. But still overall a great deal.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Fire TV is an excellent alternative to cable and satellite prison. The amount of content available is staggering. The unit functions flawlessly.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon ECHO with the dots placed around the house provide the perfect companion with all your daily tasks. I have Echo connected to my Hue lights and EchoBee Thermostats.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for streaming and learning games for kids. Good research tool for older kids.\n",
      "Positive :-> great little tablet for price, great if have amazon prime\n",
      "Positive :-> Blue is beautiful & allows grand-daughter to be able to tell which one is hers. Loves the piano program and challenging herself to play as much of the song as she can. Nice size for traveling with.\n",
      "Positive :-> Like it its very easy to understand,clear to read,easy to access to the websites.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is all you will ever need this box is fast has a usb slot so you can add space and you can use the wifi or pluge internet directly into it. This is a top end box doesnt buffer\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to setup, and install. Only took a few minutes to hookup and watching movies. Simple to use, and navigate.\n",
      "Positive :-> Simple and deluxe, functions well and holds up- even with kids and their paws. Its layout and usability a bit confusing at first. Watch out for amazon add ons to charge your account though.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great sounds good. Only criticism is there is no volume control like the dots for manual adjustments\n",
      "Positive :-> I had an original Kindle DX and a Kindle keyboard. I decided to upgrade and get the Paperwhite and I'm glad I did. The light is great for reading where it isn't very bright. The e-ink is great for reading outdoors or anywhere. It's easier on the eyes than reading on my Ipad. I still read physical books too, but the Paperwhite is great for traveling and just tucking in my purse to take everywhere. I recommend it to anyone who likes to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids were wrestling me, and I called for Alexa to help. Guess it didn't understand my screaming from the other room.OK Best Buy, give me my 25 points.\n",
      "Positive :-> Getting used to it. Sometimes she doesn't respond.\n",
      "Positive :-> My nephew liked it and uses it, might not be an ipad but it works\n",
      "Positive :-> Controls everything in my home. I would definitely buy it again.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this and onother one in blue. The kids love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Use it everyday...sign up for amazon prime and watch almost anything..\n",
      "Positive :-> what i read about it looked like a great gift for my grnaddaughter\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my first fire. I am enjoying the apps. It was easy to set up. The instructions are clear and easy to understand. I will recommend this product to others.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love shopping at Best Buys. Better deals than Walmart.\n",
      "Positive :-> The size is nice for portability, roughly the size of a normal paperback, nice features, very easy to use, adding books to it is a very easy procedure, either downloading or hooking it up to the computer to transfer .pdfs, etc.\n",
      "Positive :-> We love the Echo. Great sound for music, turning lights on and off and now have it connected to our Roomba. We also ordered the battery for it as to move it outside for the music.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon voyage really is a fantastic ereader. Prior to owning this tablet, I had a couple of PW2's which are great tablets in their own right. My wife knew that I had my eye on the Kindle Voyage but I was waiting to catch it during one of Amazon's rare sales events. Unfortunately my wife ended up buying it for me for Father's Day and I planned to take it back and wait for a sale but after comparing it to my PW2 side by side, I decided I couldn't wait for it to get cheaper and so I kept it. The PW2 is a great ereader (ended up giving it to my oldest son) but the Voyage is more crisp and the backlighting is quite a bit whiter. It's also a couple of ounces lighter and slimmer. Is it worth the upgrade? Definitely, if you can get it on sale (usually $150). At $199? Well, that's up to you. Obviously I paid full freight and I don't regret it.....much. :) With that being said, the PW3 is worth a look too. Same 300 ppi clarity but usually $80 to $100 cheaper. The Voyage has a bezel that's flush with it's glass so it's not the \"crumb catcher\" paperwhite is but hey, maybe you want to skip eating while you're reading and save the dough!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great eBook reader around the house & free WiFi areas ( some McDs, Starbucks, etc. ).Got this as: 1. It's 50 Bucks.2. Doesn't hurt so much if you fall asleep while reading ( doesn't weigh as much as a \"full-size\" tablet ) 3. Fits in my pants pocket so you can take it with you.4. Lots of free books from Amazon.5. Did I mention it's $50.00?\n",
      "Positive :-> i ENJOYED HOW IT TELLS ME MY CALENDARSCHEDULE AND PLAYS MUSIC FROM MY LIBRARY OF MANY SOURCES.CHECKING TRAFFIC TO MY OFFICE AND HAVING ALEXA READ TO ME ADDED JOYS.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not bad for an entry-level tablet. Pretty much what I expected for the price I paid for it. My four-year-old loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for cord cutting. Just needs a little cleaning up to do. Sorting through the content can be a little confusing.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great Tablet for the price and works really well... Cannot go wrong with this Tablet\n",
      "Negative :-> i love it just dont waste your money to pay for geek squad to install it, it takes less than 5 min and it basically installs itself\n",
      "Positive :-> I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy!\n",
      "Positive :-> My husband got this for Father's Day. He loves the ease of downloading his favorite music and books.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter love this tablet! Easy to use and carry\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet because it was so cheap! My husband loves it. It comes with many free games (games that you'd have to pay for if you had an iPad).\n",
      "Positive :-> I got it for my daughter who really loves it, it is very easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> This Echo is amazing!! I love waking up and not having to use a remote or get out of bed.. she does a lot.. and the names are perfect Alexa or Amazon.. but it's a great speaker loud..\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Was tired of using my iPad as my sole reader. Decided to go back to Kindle. This is by far the best Amazon has done in the Kindle arena yet. Simplistic, sleek & no more eye strain.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!\n",
      "Positive :-> It is like having a stereo with every song. We have just started to use this incredible device\n",
      "Positive :-> great buy for the price. Very vanilla and a little small but you cant beat the price for a beginners tablet or a cheap replacement.\n",
      "Positive :-> I received this as a gift and loved it so much that I bought one for my husband.\n",
      "Positive :-> You cannot beat the fire stick for the money, a great bargain to say the least.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect for my needs and the needs of my students!\n",
      "Positive :-> The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors.\n",
      "Positive :-> The screen breaks way to easy it drop one time broke\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 2 of these, 1 for each of my 2 youngest Grandaughters. Wanted something that would be made well, easy to use and as they get older the range of use could expand. Not only is it a good activity but a great learning tool. I will download fun and game activities but learning also even though many of the fun and game are learning tools. Their ages are 3 1/2 and 5 and they love them. Easy to download items, save to home screen or remove items. Their are several parental controls and options so you can feel worry free. Can add more than one user and profile.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a fun little toy but lacks practicality. In order to make it user friendly, I recommend a battery for it. You will also need Amazon prime in order for the music to play worth a darn. Otherwise you will be stuck searching through your phone for your song.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet was good enough for reading, check email and watch some movies on internet. It doesn't has a lot of option for free app as Samsung or Apple devices.\n",
      "Positive :-> Sound is great. Voice control excellent and works with other ambient noise. Great for music, facts ,news and general info.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great item for the home we have used this item daily now\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet was a gift to my nine year old and he loves it nice resolution fast, and slim. Cant beat it for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is a great beginner tablet. Amazing price! My child has used it over the last year with no issues. I'm buying another as a gift.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and very happy with it\n",
      "Positive :-> Not indispensable, but handy. Set alarms, timers, make shopping lists. Could easily expand applications with extra hardware\n",
      "Positive :-> A bit difficult to get working with other smart home devices. After Some trial and error with my smart things hub, and IFTT commands it works great. Would increase to five star review if it was a bit easier to get up and running.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amarion tablet the speakers are really good but could be at the front\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the Amazon echo. It a great device for finding answers to questions or listening to music. On side note it is a great learning tool for a grade school student. Love playing 20 questions, getting the local weather report and keeping shopping lists.\n",
      "Positive :-> I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> Would buy again. First tablet. Having the time of my life with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet, easy to use. I used to carry a laptop when traveling, now this does everything I need.\n",
      "Positive :-> Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product!! A good product for the price!! Great battery life\n",
      "Positive :-> Had a fire stick and loved it. Eventually got this because I wanted the 4K capabilities. My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner. I use it for sling tv a lot as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my wife. She loves it. It works very well, no problems. She plays a lot of games on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great idea for a 5 years old. very secure and good contents for that age.\n",
      "Positive :-> Finally an affordable name brand tablet with all the bells and whistles. Amazon has outdone it's self with this little gem.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very study tablets. 2 others grands liked theirs. Salesman was very helpful finding 2 different color models\n",
      "Positive :-> replaced a lost one with this, nice upgrade to the older version\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for the price.. Good for gifting, if you don't want to spend too much :)\n",
      "Positive :-> The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a gift for one of my granddaughters. She just loves this Kindle. This is the second one I've bought for her. This is a bigger and newer generation with lots more options.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for my bedroom since I have the stick downstairs close to my Wifi router and have had no issues with it. This is even better than the stick and has no buffering or lag issues whatsoever for the normal things I watch and stream. Highly recommended!\n",

      "Positive :-> Holding up well but purchased a good case. Like the kindle a lot.\n",
      "Positive :-> The product works fine, but you need to install a bunch of apps to use to its full potential.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love Amazon now there's so much functionality especially with video. This works great and the quality is amazing\n",
      "Positive :-> New OS 5 performs better than expected. No hanging screens and increased caching enables better video streaming. I purchased this as a replacement for an older model that my son broke - would definitely buy again.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to use. Size is just right --not cumbersome at all.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy setup nice size only thing is the charger cords need to be more sturdy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon kindle is a very good to keep yourself busy with a good book.\n",
      "Positive :-> Cool device , pretty much answers everything. Takes time to pair with other devices.\n",
      "Positive :-> Worth the money it is a very useful device . Buy this if you are an avid reader\n",
      "Positive :-> Having a Kindle is awesome. It makes it very easy to read and I gobbled up over 800 pages before I had to charge it for the first time since I got it. Great purchase!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this for my Down Syndrome sister who enjoy playing games on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> We got this for my son to use as a reader and also do audio books with read along. It has been great. He had a laptop but that is too large to be practical. This works perfectly for him.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you are a Prime member its a good little speaker to have. Need WIFI or Hotspot.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter bought a Kindle Fire when it cost $200 and thought it was a good deal for something that did so much. Mine was only $50 at my local Best Buy, and it's truly a marvel -- I can watch TV and movies from my library, read books and emails, and order products. I can't imagine any more for any less. Clear, bright colors, crisp lettering, although small (I bought the 7-inch screen).\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this to activate playstation vue and have had good luck with it so far.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect tablet for my 7 year old girl. She really enjoys it.\n",
      "Positive :-> The PaperWhite is a great reader. Nice to read in the sun! Nice to read indoors. Very happy.\n",

      "Positive :-> I was so against getting one but finally caved! This is so easy to use and i take it with my everywherePerfect for reading outside or on the train\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the first e-reader I've gotten and I LOVE it! In general, kindles are awesome because there is a bunch of free material you can download on amazon that you can just carry around with you. The page turning function is a little weird to get used to but you can also swipe if you don't like the sensors on the side. When you turn off the kindle there is a screen saver that is typically some kind of ad, which is kind of annoying, but it's not really worth it to pay to have the ads taken off. Again, just something to get used to. It's really easy to navigate, you can even highlight and take notes. I don't really now too much about other e-readers or kindles but I'm really happy I bought this and I'd recommend it to anyone!\n",
      "Positive :-> Not too satisfied with the sound and it loses Bluetooth connection no matter what phone I use (either Iphone or Android).\n",
      "Positive :-> Needs to buffer less frequently than the current gen Fire stick. Plugged it in and was watching movies on Kodi within 45 minutes. Pretty happy with this.\n",

      "Positive :-> Bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. Great investment\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for an employee of mine. She loves it. It is light compact and allows her to carry tons of books with her. She is huge book reader so this is a must for anyone that is a big reader. She always thinks it is really easy to read also with the white background.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got two for my mom's and they love it. So many great features!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this tablet for my grandmother for Christmas. She is not the most \"tech savvy\" person but absolutely loves this tablet. Very simple interface and reactive\n",

      "Positive :-> I purchased this echo as a gift it was exactly what she wanted\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet is great for our 8 year old grandchildren to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Wow! it is so nice to have a light and easy to hold device that only carries tons of books! No distractions like on my iPad, with email messages pinging in and facebook updates to check...just books and lots of them!The Kindle Voyage is everything they said it would be...light, back lit with self adjusting levels, page turners, all the bells and whistles. I am so glad I waited and splurged for this one!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for young ages and can be stored easily in school backpack\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this included in a package deal with our Harmony Elite a few months back, and it has served as a decent add-on accessory throughout our home. We mainly use it as a bluetooth speaker for our mobile devices since the Amazon Prime Music library is pretty sparse, and Alexa isn't nearly as advanced as Siri in terms of answering questions. However, I was able to create a rule using Amazon's API that allowed me to link Google search. Alexa is also inconsistent with performing smart home tasks, but I'm sure this will improve over time. I wouldn't pay full price for this device, but I would recommend if you can find it on sale.\n",
      "Positive :-> A little slow but overall good first tablet for kids\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet for my wife. She likes the size for reading books and for reading info on the web. The tablet's size is a little big for just holding it and for carrying it around. It also has to be charged often, and that's not even considering time reading books. Hard to find a case for this latest kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> Picture quality is great and wide variety of features\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great charges reasonably fast I'm satisfied with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great for a tablet and inexpensive. I got three in the past year and they all work great. I got them as gifts but I believe they don't have the same apps you can get through apple and Google play. You may want to check that out if you are using it for those apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet with reasonable price. Best one from amazon\n",
      "Negative :-> Frustrated that it has a hard time understanding me.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a much faster and easy to use media player.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great for Vue, and other apps if you don't have a smart TV. Better quality on Vue than my PS4\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this to replace a Sony reader--can't get books for it anymore. That's all I really wanted it for, but I have played around with it to go on-line or check e-mail. Pretty easy to use (but it comes with next to NO instructions). If anything, it comes preloaded with too much stuff. But they are all freebies, so I don't care. I like being able to adjust the type face size, turning the page with a flick of my finger and always coming back to where I am in my book if I put the system to sleep. It has a back lit screen, so I can read in bed or in the dark even without disturbing my husband. I'm very happy with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Mainly use for music and to-do/shopping lists. Inquiries about basic information are answered with accuracy, but more complex questions (\"describe the limbic system\", etc) are not answered. Sound is average.If you are looking for in depth answers, this device will disappoint you. Great for fairly common stuff.\n",
      "Positive :-> Had to get this tablet it was a great price and came with free amazon movies for a year, I just had to change the case.\n",
      "Positive :-> I thought this would just be a fun novelty but it isn't. Set up was a snap and i located it centrally in our home via WiFi. No problem at all and it worked the first time. I have a Kindle Fire tablet and that does help a bit in management. Once set up i then added skills and even used IFTT. So now, i have a flash briefing with news i am interested in, my WEMO lights are controlled by voice as well as WEMO app, i listen to my music, i get the weather information, my family listens to jokes and much more.\n",
      "Positive :-> A great streaming device that I use on a daily basis.\n",
      "Positive :-> I just do know how I can live without my new firestick! It's so easy to use and so much to see because of this!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy setup. Compact. For reading, I still prefer my basic Kindle Reader, but the apps are nice to have when I want to do some extra things on the Fire.\n",
      "Positive :-> I took it on vacation in the Bahamas and Bald Head and read in the sun and in the pool.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fire TV was just about equal to the nexus player. and it it more expensive\n",
      "Positive :-> The value of this device is amazing, the battery life could use some work tho\n",
      "Positive :-> I am happy with this product thus far. I like the size and the screen quality is just okay. I am use to the iPad quality of screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> Hard to beat, especially during Black Friday at $35. Meets the needs.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 8 year old son saved up his allowance money in order to buy this tablet. He did all of the research himself and decided that based on the price and the features that this was the tablet for him. He can connect to our home Wi Fi to access the internet, You Tube and games. We monitor what he is accessing for safety purposes. This is much smaller than an iPad, but is very mobile and easy for kids to use. I bought a case for it to protect it from drops and allows my son to work from multiple angles on the tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great item works perfect and great protection. Exactly what I needed.\n",
      "Positive :-> GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought these tablets for my grandchildren, ages 8 & 11, because they love playing games on mine when they come to visit me. Oh the smiles on their faces when they opened them up :)\n",
      "Positive :-> Every home needs one and very reasonable priced! Easy set up\n",
      "Positive :-> A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing.\n",
      "Positive :-> The product is very nice. It is very useful and the battery life is great. It crashes every once in a while but apart from that it is an excellent product to gift to someone due to the convenient price!\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for the price. Expandable memory. Laggy at times.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was searching on Amazon for the Kindle 7 but it was out of stock until AFTER Christmas. Went to Best Buy and found they had more than enough in stock. Got one for my daughter who loves it. Thanks!\n",

      "Positive :-> Everyone is able to use this. Even the 4 and 5 year old grand kids .\n",
      "Negative :-> Charge the device and was able to set up everything and when I came back to use it it would not work\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can't be beat!\n",
      "Positive :-> simple and easy to operate; very fun to work with for business or leisure\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some.\n",
      "Positive :-> Best Fire tablet at a reasonable price. Much faster than the 7 inch.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. She would use her Mom's phone to watch her shows but now that she has her tablet she can watch her own and see it much better. Homerun on this Christmas present!\n",
      "Positive :-> Samsung Experience Professionals Jon, Neil and Tony were an ideal match for someone looking to upgrade to a new phone. The sales deal was unbelievable - $200 Best Buy card upon upgrade to a Galaxy 7 phone. The sales points that won my business were battery life and charging power. New phone can connect wireless charge without adapter. I am a very happy customer.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my 21 month old daughter and she has already learned how to use it. What a great way to keep her busy and quiet at the same time. Thanks\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for reading books and digital comics and the perfect entry-level tablet for Amazon's grand ecosystem. If you like this, you can upgrade in the future to something with more storage and power.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this Kindle. It syncs without needing to prompt for it, downloads new books quickly and the backlighting is effective even at low levels so I don't disturb my sleeping husband when I want to read in bed. Its compact and lightweight size make it easy to carry anywhere and comfortable to hold.\n",
      "Positive :-> I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go.\n",

      "Positive :-> Beautiful screen, vibrant color, fast and best quality for the money.\n",

      "Positive :-> It works well and you can do a lot of things on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a raffle prize and it was a big hit of the young as well as the old.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought these for my niece and nephews for Christmas. They love them! They know how to turn them on and locate an app. I love being able to set time limits so they aren't on their tablets very often! Great investment!\n",
      "Positive :-> Love our Echo. It has great sound quality. Very helpful with conversions when baking.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am greatly satisfied with this tablet. And the price is great too.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use to have the Apple tv and I like the fire tv more due to the streaming and voice activation. I have just recently purchased this item but the streaming is quick and it is very easy to maneuver through the channels. I have told some of my clients about the fire tv over the Apple tv.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nothing is ever perfect. I'm sure my product has some flaws in it, which I'm okay with. As long as they don't effect the usage I'm happy. Sometimes takes a second to register me pushing the letters, but nothing too big.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent speakers for this price range. Combines Bluetooth playback and streaming services. Alexa voice commands are a very convenient way to navigate and get general information.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great pay back for each $ spent. Basic tablet, very good for reading and surfing.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my FireStick but the addition of 4K streaming is worth getting the FireTV. It seems to be noticeably faster as well.\n",

      "Positive :-> Good cheap tablet. Not very powerful but it does the basics.\n",

      "Positive :-> I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!\n",

      "Positive :-> It's 2017 and I was wondering to myself if I should jump on board and get a Kindle paper white. Now and days, people can read ebooks from smartphones to tablets. The thing with me is it caused me eye strain after trying to read my kindle books through my iPad. After much researching and reading the reviews on here, the paper white has been the best purchase decision I've made in order to just sit back and read without causing eye strain. This is only for reading ebooks and is very simple to use. Battery life is amazing and only charge once every two weeks. If you are just looking for a plain ereader, then this gem is your best bet.\n",
      "Positive :-> We both really enjoy our Echo. There was no problem setting it up. I literally just plugged it in and haven't touched it since. Besides enjoying the music we really like the \"Shopping List.\". The weather function is great also. As far as it's sound, it has a little too much bass for me. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars\n",
      "Positive :-> My wife loves her Kindke and at this price it was a no brainer. It's fast with a ton of expandable memory storage.\n",
      "Positive :-> Product does not disappoint. It does what it says.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet ! I got it on sale around Thanksgiving and it was worth it.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is very easy to set up and use. It has great functions, but am waiting for more to be added to give 5 stars.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased 7 of these tablets on black friday. We have enjoyed them a lot. I was worried about the clarity of games, since they aren't hd. But, they are fantastic. Lots of free books, apps, games. Very happy with my purchase\n",
      "Negative :-> I want to start out by pointing out that I honestly was not expecting much to begin with. I was just hoping for something backlit to read with at night. My problem with it is that it was slow to the point where it was almost unusable. Just bite the bullet and get a more expensive model if you're new to Amazon Fire. This is not representative of the experience of owning one.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you know of someone that would like to view videos or play smaller games, then this is a great product for them. This is more like an entry level tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> We've had a lot of fun programing and working with the Amazon Echo.

      "Positive :-> I had an old Sony e-reader that I loved but it wasn't working too well anymore. I decided that a Kindle was the only viable replacement on the market right now.

      "Positive :-> Just writing this review to get my points...This was a gift for my mother. I think she likes it fine.\n",

      "Positive :-> Would recommend for anyone great value big screen great features\n",
      "Positive :-> From the beginning we've had issues with our remote\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for young children and beginners. Has all the basic features needed to enjoy this tablet\n",
      "Positive :-> As a ebooker reader this is absolutely best in the market right now, very easy to use. Now the only downside is the feeling of touch screen is too rough.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this gor my daughter she enjoyed that she was able to stream her videos and also do her school work.\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought two of these Fire Tables online Black Friday. We loaded Google Play and then our Google accounts. I still can't believe they were only $35. One of the most exceptional buys for Christmas...or EVER. Very happy.\n",
      "Positive :-> So far this kindle works great. Have used it in the dark and on the beach and have no visibility problems! Very satisfied.\n",
      "Positive :-> I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the \"tap\" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist! If only...\n",
      "Positive :-> Great selection of apps, books, overall everything, daughter loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> My son loves it, reads every day now. I love the fact, there is no internet/games to destruct him from reading. Small size allows to take it everywhere, wonderful screen for eyes. Just perfect!\n",

      "Positive :-> The one purchased at Best Buy had black and gray lines appearing across the screen when powering up. It got worse, to occurring while using it.

      "Positive :-> Alexa is great addition to our kitchen. Still exploring all she can do. Easy set up through android.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is our second Amazon Fire TV. They are great and we've never had any issues with it. We really love the Amazon Prime membership as well.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my first streaming TV device and I am new to the technology. It was very easy to set up and configure, taking only a few minutes. It worked like a charm! I then downloaded Kodi onto the device, following a youtube instructional video. While Kodi takes a little more patience and time, once installed, it is an awesome supplement to the Fire TV. Between the built-in service offerings and the vast amount of free streaming services offered via Kodi, this device is a 100% winner!!! No more cable and satellite TV subscriptions for this person!!\n",
      "Positive :-> awesome product. Very glad I made the small investment to get this. I don't even have to use my cable anymore because of this small device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this Kindle for my teenage daughter and she absolutely loves it! She is able to read outside in the sunshine and at night in the dark. Very easy to navigate.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is a great device. The only drawback is not being able to simultaneously stream all devices throughout the house. Hopefully Amazon is working on a solution\n",
      "Positive :-> Great to interact with a product by voice that can provide information as well as enjoyment\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product works like a charm and has great speed even with bad internet service would recommend\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this along with the fire stick and the fire tv works way better\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my Echo. Has amazing stereo sound and has lots of new items added on a regular basis. I use it for nites, reminders, timers, setting alarms, music and general knowledge.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to setup, customizable, and affordable android box. Highly recommended for your android needs.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my new fire tv. Don't have to wait for movies to refresh.. awesome!!\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is very ideal for kids...it comes with a great case that protects it well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Simple to use. Has its hiccups but for 50 bucks its the best bang for the buck. Purchased for my 6 year okd to replace an older generation model\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet. This is the third Amazon Fire I have purchased. Purchased this for my 4 year old. Got tired of sharing my tablet with her. She has tons of games and watches movies on her tablet. She also takes a lot of pictures. We decided not to get the childrens version as many reviewers stated the parental controls were annoying.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome product, works great. Good for listening to music, asking questions, connecting to smart devices, and much more!\n",
      "Positive :-> We love our Amazon Alexa!! We ask her the weather and play music everyday.\n",
      "Positive :-> For the little price I paid this was a good buy for the kids. I prefer the Amazon tablets for my kids so they can be more involved with reading.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased as a gift for daughter and she hasn't put it down yet.This is now her go to device over her laptop,MP3 player or phone. To me that speaks volumes!\n",

      "Positive :-> Got this for my mother in law as a christmas gift she loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet meets my immediate needs of email, games, even social networking. Also pleased with streaming of my favorite site. A little slow but maybe the network. Also Amazon's technical service was excellent. I had a bad day and was frustrated with start up which is easy when in your right mind, anyway the technician deescalated excellently.\n",
      "Positive :-> We started with the Nabi the 2nd edition when my son was 4. Then came a few other RCA tablets that ran out of memory or quit charging in 6 months. But I just can't justify the cost of the ipad for my 8 year old that dropped my work ipad and I had to pay $250. The Amazon fire tablet is the perfect fit for his video game playing. Since I am a prime member he loves that he can download music, books and videos for free. Being a prime member is almost necessary to make this tablet worth anything. You can only buy amazon gift cards no google play or itunes for this. So let the grandparents know. I like that it has multiple users so I can restrict the time and what he is able to view/play.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle fire is an awesome tablet for reading, browsing..Color is amazing\n",
      "Positive :-> A great convience for a busy person when needing info and organization help\n",

      "Positive :-> Great for things I need it for and is easy to store and put in my purse\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great.Great buy.Wouldn't have anything else.\n",
      "Positive :-> Does the job it’s suppsed to. Get it and enjoy life in the fast lane\n",
      "Positive :-> if you have a fire stick and use it everyday, I recommend upgrading. Actually being connected to my modem is so much faster than using the wifi signal. Less buffering with faster loads. No complaints.\n",
      "Positive :-> This item is great. I would buy it again. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought 2 of these on Black Friday becasue the price was amazing! I kept one for myself and gave the other one away as a raffle prize for our Christmas party. The recipient was really excited to get it and I like mine so far. It was pretty awesome to be able to get a reputable tablet for such a low price. Awesome buy!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present and she loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had read that the tablet supported gps, for Pokémon go. You can make Pokémon go work, but this tablet does not have built in gps, it uses wifi triangulation. It is great for watching movies, YouTube, and social media apps. It's also great for reading books.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> amazon won't let us download Plants vs Zombies.otherwise, it's terrific.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this tablet and have been pleasantly surprised how simple it is to use. Very user friendly and have not one complaint!\n",

      "Positive :-> Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games\n",
      "Positive :-> My family and I constantly use Alexa to listen to music, help with cooking, check the weather, help with homework and listen to the news. One of my favorite purchases ever.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had purchased one years ago for my mother. This was a replacement to the kindle. The fire some different features. But keeps my mother busy with mind games and sure help on that long trip to Italy.\n",
      "Positive :-> All w o raked f reat\n",
      "Positive :-> great tablet and great price that I purchase 3 for all my children. They have no complaints. And if it breaks I can easily afford buying a new one.\n",
      "Positive :-> Used to replace my wife's kindle classic that she loved to read books with.Had several Android tablets she tried to use, but they were too slow or responded incorrectly. This one is fast, responds properly and has far more capability than she is using. Only disadvantage compared to the classic is battery life, but it is certainly good enough.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is a good choice for little kids. It is not very expensive and provide nice features for the price. You can beat this!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I can use for so many different functions. It's easy to function\n",
      "Positive :-> A while ago, my Echo power supply stopped working. At the time, Amazon was out of the OEM power supply and provided me with a replacement from China. That one worked but was bulky and not as good looking as the OEM one, so I decided, when Amazon had caught up with back orders, to reorder a 'real' power supply. Very glad that I did.Sleek, stylish power supply for my Amazon Echo. Works as it should, and hopefully will last longer than my previous power supply!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my kids, 5 and 9. I wanted to get them a tablet but still restrict what they could do. This tablet has fantastic parental controls. I opted to include the FreeTime membership and that puts them into a kid-specific app center where they just click and play without the visible hassle of downloading, fees, and ads. It's been very sturdy with the 5 year old. Overall I am extremely satisfied for a kids tablet. Not sure I would buy one for me personally, but great for kids.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fantastic deal for price. Does everything I need and then some.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love being able to just ask it to do things however there is a learning curve. You have to also kind of teach it what you want.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good inexpensive tablet. I use it to control my E series vizio and andriod box. Apps open slower than on my Galaxy S7 edge but other than that everyting works as expected. Note that google play store is not available without modification\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a awesome tablet. For the price it is a awesome tablet. It is perfect size to play games. Though little small for watching videos, it works perfect for daily use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased for my 6 year old he loves it works great\n",
      "Positive :-> Almost 5 stars, dosent have all songs from different musicians.\n",
      "Positive :-> This keyboard works as a case as well for your ipad and when attached seems just like a net book...I really like it I think I will end up buying another for the mini ipad...\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it works great a lot of fun great for listening to music\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the Fire TV Box it works flawlessly. I recommend adding the Spotify App. It makes all your sorround sound Bluetooth. Worth every penny for sure . Don't think about it just buy it .\n",
      "Positive :-> Gifts for 4 yr old grandsons very easy for them to maneuver around.. great charge life. We have to force.them to take breaks.\n",
      "Positive :-> I just love this product. This is my 2nd and this is very flexible and open as against apple TV. I replaced my apple TV with fireTVs and I just love them.\n",
      "Positive :-> just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better.\n",
      "Positive :-> Christmas gift.\n",
      "Positive :-> This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. If you want to buy your kid a device, I recommend this one because it's cheap and if it breaks then it wouldn't put a big dent in your pocket to buy a new one or you won't feel bad for spending your money on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!\n",
      "Positive :-> This e reader is very excellent.The screen is a bit small but you can accommodate.\n",
      "Positive :-> I gave this as a Christmas gift and my friend really likes it.\n",
      "Positive :-> i no longer us tv this is my new go to for my tv show needs\n",
      "Positive :-> works great in bright sun also. downloads fast and is compact so I can take it anywhere.\n",
      "Positive :-> So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is Great. I use it all the time easy to use great product\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought this to download movies and books onto for a long plane ride. It worked great! Very happy with the purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> I researched other tablets before purchasing the Amazon Fire Kids Edition. This tablet is everything I thought it would be and more. Great price too. Lots of available features and apps. Very easy to use. My 2 year old grandson loves it!!! He' s having lots of fun and learning.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love fireTVs and Firesticks. They always work well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Product serves as reader and simple tablet. Used as personal device when traveling. Good product for the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fastest product I have ever used highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a lag free experience\n",
      "Positive :-> I've been considering the whole \"smart home\" phenomenon for a while. Even though I love tech in general, this particular aspect didn't seem to have much appeal for me personally. My impression was that it hadn't quite arrived yet. Then some friends got the Echo along with the Hue lighting system and the Nest thermostat. When I saw how well it all integrated and just how cool it is, I was intrigued. That was enough for me to take the plunge. Now I have all three and I love how they all work together. Alexa is at the heart of it with many handy features. She can give me weather, traffic and news. She can turn on or turn off my lights and adjust the heat. She can set a timer when I'm cooking. She can check my Google calendar to remind me of appointments and birthdays. She can answer many (but certainly not all) of my random trivia questions. Some of her responses are funny and cute Easter eggs. Her built-in shopping and to-do lists are rather basic, so I haven't found much use for them yet. She processes my requests, with only the occasional misunderstanding. Her microphones are sensitive enough to hear me in the living room from the top of the stairs in my townhome (although I did get the optional remote for the bedroom). Only sometimes do I have to repeat myself if I don't speak clearly enough or my phrasing is awkward. Amazingly, she knows to control the correct fixture when, for example, I accidentally say \"table lamp\" instead of \"table light,\" as the bulb is actually labeled in the system. The setup was quick and easy, both for the Echo itself and the integration with the Nest and the Hue bridge. The app is easy to use, with only one minor issue (see below).Her internal speakers aren't spectacular, but they're acceptable for background music while doing chores or puttering around the house. Using the app to establish a connection to the Bluetooth adapter for my old stereo system wasn't particularly intuitive, but following the instructions posted on the Amazon web site got it done. Now I can stream music through the Echo itself or through my stereo for better quality, depending on my mood. You can integrate services like Pandora and Spotify, but I just use Amazon Prime Music, since I already subscribe to it.Naysayers will rightly point out that you can do all of the above things with other simpler devices, and of course, they're right. The Echo is certainly a luxury, a toy even, but it is fun and useful for me. In my experience and for my purposes, it works well with only minor limitations. It met and exceeded my expectations. You have to judge the overall value for yourself, but if you're already considering the Echo and what it can do for you, I strongly recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Let's be perfectly clear, this is not an IPAD. But for $50.00 this 7\" Fire is a steal. I'm very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the paperwhite. It's a good size. Only drawback is the ads on the lockscreen! I can't see how to get rid of them. I like the old display of authors better.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two kindles one for my daughter and one for my god daughter and I love it. I can let them use it and they can download whatever they want for free such as books and kid friendly games. I don't have to worry. It can also be used like a normal tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Amazon echo. Amazon is always updating the software so Alexa is always learning new things that can be useful on a daily basis.\n",
      "Positive :-> Echo is a great product. Wish it had better understanding i find myself having to repeat often but other than that i love it great product\n",
      "Positive :-> It's an awesome product. The sound is pretty impressive from such a small cylinder. News, sports, weather, jokes, and nearly whole house control. We love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased for my grandson, he loves it. Purchased a blue cover for him\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for my son. I monitor school work and apps he downloads.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a pretty good little tablet for a beginner. I bought this for my 11 year old son and he loves it!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been missing out on reading books. This kindle is perfect. My wonderful husband gave this to me for my birthday. What a wonderful surprise.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great to travel with . Overall it is user friendly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tool to start a smart home. Interfaces well with current apps\n",
      "Neutral :-> On the second day the unit disconnected from my wireless network and when attempted to reconnect the remote would not work and I could not click on the network settings button. I return that unit for another Amazon fire and the second unit could not find the remote to pair it. I think I will purchase a google or apple next .\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it. Use it daily for everything. Love the options and looks.\n",
      "Positive :-> This thing does so many things it's incredible. Time saver, information finder , and even a family entertainer!\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Definitely easy to use, easy to download books, and navigate pages.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my Echo. I use it mostly for music but it doesn't everything I need it to! It's also very handy in the kitchen for things like timers, recipes and measurements\n",
      "Positive :-> Daughter gave me one last year, so I returned the favor this year! She's thrilled and obsessed (her words)!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> My grandson is 2 years old and loves his tablet. I do recommended for young kids\n",
      "Positive :-> Was happy to get the toy for my son for Christmas and they won't stop playing it\n",
      "Positive :-> I love the Kindle Fire, it is wonderful for playing games and watching movies\n",
      "Positive :-> a great price and lots of free games my grandson loves a wonderful pass time with all in one books and games and info\n",
      "Positive :-> Really good quality piece and would strongly recommend\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the voice feature and since going to this I have saved tons on cable bills\n",
      "Positive :-> Does what I wanted and then more. I would recommend this to others.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works as described. I really like the ease of use when it comes to the interface.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nothing too special or complicated. Fills the need.\n",
      "Positive :-> The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.\n",
      "Positive :-> Note, the information on the Best Buy site is wrong, this is not a 4G device but rather a 3G device. It really makes no difference but just for clarity, lets get it right. Very light and small e-reader with a very good display and the squeeze functionality for page turning is a nice addition. Not a revolutionary device but evolutionary.\n",
      "Positive :-> Gave one of these to my sister for Christmas, who then RAVED about it. She said it was awesome. So I got one. I'm happy with it and I even got the remote, too.I especially like being able to tell it to add things to the shopping list/to-do list. In addition, I get a daily news briefing and get the best commute route for the morning.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am happy to report that the kids are happy with their gifts.\n",
      "Positive :-> like the wihite background and its really easy to use anywhere\n",
      "Positive :-> I'm really happy that I purchased this Amazon Fire TV Box. It works great and so easy to use. Definitely worth the price!\n",
      "Positive :-> Wonderful educational tool for my niece with special needs.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love Alexa. I have 3 echoes now and 2 dots. I haven't played with them a lot but I love them. It's convenient to ask about the weather when you are getting ready for work or going out.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this on sale for 33 dollars and I expected something different because of the low price. I would pay a hundred for a replacement if this one ever breaks. Very good product.\n",
      "Positive :-> Not as comprehensive as I thought.Basic questions avaid her perview.I hope there will be some software upgrades soon.\n",
      "Positive :-> Makes reading books easier. I love it! User friendly too!\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this box's for a gift and they love it and for that price can't beat that\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product no complaints, spend a little extra on good internet and never worry about cable.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use echo everyday to check on weather and listen to music\n",
      "Positive :-> It works great.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had a Kindle Fire HD 6\" but felt it was too small a screen and too heavy for how small it was. The Kindle Fire 7\" is perfect for me. I don't watch movies or videos so not having HD doesn't bother me. I am enjoying this one more.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this as a gift for outdoor reading in the sun etc. It works quite well and was proved reasonably.\n",
      "Positive :-> It will be great if the screen is larger. Otherwise it is good.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the paperwhite. Option of backlighting is great when reading in the dark but still able to see when outside in the sun. I do wish it had adaptive backlighting (I prefer to have backpighting off to save battery during daylight reading). Overall a great reading device.\n",
      "Neutral :-> I prefer the iPad but it's okay for the cost just to many ads tho\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good media player with a lot of options and features.\n",
      "Positive :-> My wife is an avid reader and ju St had surgery. On her neck. She is healing well but finds it hard to hold the weight of a book. i bought the kindle for her ad she loves it because she reads in bed and can easily handle it because it is so light. She loves that she can get books in French and any other language she wants.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this tablet, it is better than my ipad! There are unlimited full length games, books, etc. I wait for my granddaughter to go to sleep, so I can play it! Great battery life, too. I highly recommend this tablet for adults and children!\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been wanting to give these little tablets a try for some time now. I went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale. I'm originally an Apple guy, but my iPad has seen better days.The tablet is nestled in compact packaging. Inside you will find the sync cable/charger, and the tablet itself. It comes wrapped in a protective plastic bag. It looks pretty good quality, and feels great in my hands. It is very easy to grasp with one hand, leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do.The setup is really straight forward with a few simple questions. If you are already an Amazon customer, you will be asked to input your information during setup...making it even easier to get started. The picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet. It's not HD, but the quality is still pretty good for everyday tasks. Amazon's app store is packed with tons of apps, movies, books, etc... There is definitely plenty to choose. I have access to Amazon videos, store, and everything Amazon at the palm of my hands. The only downside to the tablet is that Amazon uses its own \"Silk Browser,\" which I am not a very big fan of. I tried to see if I could download Chrome, but that is still not an option. Hopefully it will be some time in the future. The browser is a bit slow in certain web pages, but functional. Another thing that I found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my e-mail account to the tablet. The only thing that I notices was that it took a while to load my account, but the setup is very easy. You have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hands. Overall, this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low cost tablet. It may take some folks a some time to get use to Amazon's OS, but it should not take very long to do so.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this as a gift. Waiting for the owner to advise.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love this tablet. It's big enough so I can see. It works with my prime so I can watch movies or stream music.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up, and easy to use. Can read in bright sunlight with no glare at all. Performs as advertised. Battery life is exceptional. Will last for 8 to 10 hours on a charge depending on brightness setting.Would recommend this to any avid reader. It is light and will hold hundreds of books.\n",
      "Positive :-> I LIKE IT BUT WHAT I DONT LIKE ARE THE ADS THAT HIDE AS SCREEN SAVERS. INTRUSIVE.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more\n",
      "Positive :-> My mom had been wanting one for a while, so this was great.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have to say, I'm loving it! I have an older Samsung \"Smart\" TV, but Samsung has stopped updating the Smart Hub for my model. The Amazon Fire TV gets the latest updates from the Apps (i.e. Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, etc...) , so I know everything will work smoothly!\n",
      "Positive :-> I got these for my 4 and 8 year old. They love them\n",
      "Positive :-> Works good... Not sure if prime makes getting free books better or not but she gets a lot of em!\n",
      "Positive :-> So far so good. My son loves it for his room and gives him ability to watch netflix\n",
      "Positive :-> I decided to get the Fire TV after one of my remote Media Centers failed. With my movie collection on my server, I was able to install Kodi on the Fire TV and continue to stream my movies over the network. Add in our subscription to Netflix, HBO GO, Stars Play, and Amazon Prime membership, the Fire TV offers a wide range of entertainment.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is light and easy to carry. I can read books everywhere now.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Christmas gift for 8 yr. Ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. Kids....... Great 2yr protection tho\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased for a child. Works great Very pleased. Very versatile\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is great! I would recommend it to anyone! She answers any question. I ask. I love her for the speaker aspect of things .\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this as a gift for my husband and didn't know what exactly it was all about. Once we installed it and saw all of the things we can watch on it, I was hooked. Very easy to navigate through all of the apps. Considering dropping our cable provider because most of the shows we watch are available through Fire TV. Highly recommend! We will also be purchasing a couple of Firesticks so we can watch in other rooms.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased for my 9 year old daughter, its a plus\n",
      "Positive :-> I had an older kindle, and some of the features were easier to understand. But I do like that I can keep track of the book pages, if I choose to use that feature in the paperwhite edition.\n",
      "Positive :-> A welcome addition to online streaming. Easy menu and controls for navigation.No buffering issues noticed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends\n",
      "Positive :-> Very nice product...Had everything we were looking for...\n",
      "Positive :-> Really enjoyed this product, books, music, weather, news at my finger tip. A big part of my life. I use at on the train, on my breaks at work, at home.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Kindle is really light weight and has an excellent screen that dims or brightens automatically. Very comfortable to hold and read. I like that it has page advance buttons on both sides including the touch screen finger swipe to advance.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a nice reader that we gave to our granddaughter. She enjoys he childrens books she can read and we enjoy the limited Wi-Fi capabilities.\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter gave me an iPad for Christmas. Had kindle before old one had broken screen. Not repairable on my geek plan. Bought this one for self for Christmas. Don't need both.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works as expected without any glitches.Very happy with the purchase\n",
      "Positive :-> It's great if you don't download a lot of books. Storage is filled quickly\n",
      "Positive :-> A little complicated in the beginning when opening the apps but once you get the hang of it then it's easy and fast.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for my nephew, great activities, and more for him to learn.\n",
      "Positive :-> Will buy this product at this price range again if needed.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend....\n",
      "Positive :-> Great stuff for reading. I have been taking it everywhere with me. Reading is never more simple!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great little tablet I gave as a gift to my mom. She is not tech savvy at all and she seems to have no real issues using it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Hopefully, this will at least work as an e-reader. Otherwise, Amazon has it locked up so tight one cannot do much else with it. And, even with my fiber optic Wi-Fi it is slower than cold molasses in January in Canada. Well, I needed a Kindle e-reader and for $40 that is ok.\n",
      "Positive :-> Its easy ro get those daily task complete. It enable ayou to do more to make my days easier\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. The future of reading is paperless!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the perfect companion for stay at home bodies. Very informative, helpful and entertaining. The speaker is good for a stand alone unit.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tool for every day life and excellent sound.Highly recommended.\n",
      "Positive :-> 4th amazon product I own it is a great budget tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's great to have a, \"know it all\" in the house now. I've been trying to stump her all day but she keeps giving me answers.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works flawlessly with amazon users especially those with prime accounts.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet works well for me. I use it mainly for checking my email instead of having to log in into my computer all the time. I don't have a smartphone so it is perfect for me.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Very high quality item good sound. However preferred the google knowledge of the google home so ended up returning this item.\n",
      "Positive :-> The screen is big and the Kindle is easy to navigate. Having Amazon prime definitely makes it worth the investment\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my third paperwhite and sned it as a gift.\n",
      "Positive :-> An amazing, interactive, fun machine. Superb sound, powerful mike, and with internet connection, unlimited music.\n",
      "Positive :-> The family loves this because they can communicate to this device and ask it to play their favorite songs or questions or just about anything you can Google.. Even jokes!\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome steaming device, compared to the Roku 3 I would give the Amazon Fire TV the edge. Great buy, I would recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about cutting the cord on their cable subscription.\n",
      "Positive :-> This Paperwhite (back-lit) Kindle is wonderful. No more Itty-bitty book light needed! Just turn on and read, even at night. And there is no glow during the daylight. In addition, I took it to the beach and read it there..no glare unlike the iPad. I had one of the early Kindles, so maneurving around the menu is different but easy to learn and get use to.\n",
      "Positive :-> In my honest opinion spend the extra money on the FireTV and directly connect it to your router. If you have Brighthouse internet then you'll understand why. Their hardware constantly has wifi issues. So much happier that this plugs directly into the router and my streaming is no longer interrupted.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this unit because I needed a portable bluetooth speaker. When it was on sale, I figured why not get Alexa with it. It works well. I plan to use it when I am overseas in my hotel. We'll see how that goes.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this product for my ten year old daughter. She absolutely loves it! It was easy to use, simple to navigate, and even easier to set-up (especially all of the parental controls and such). I am able to manage her account online and limit her use and time on the tablet, as well as keep track of any purchases she may wish to make. It is a great starter tablet for a responsible youth.\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought this Kindle for our son... he's moving up in the high school years and more books are required for reading so instead of buying books or waiting for availability at the local library it was the smart choice... download and read!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this product. It is exactly what I was hoping it would be.\n",
      "Positive :-> I would recommend you get thisome product It helps with a lot of questions me and the kids might have. Listen to Music Weather and News.. Love It!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> The latest software update included hands free mode. So this can do everything that the stationary Echo speaker does, but is fully portable. Personally, I don't want the device to record everything I say all the time, so I only use the tap mode. The sound quality is good for a speaker of this size. This is especially a great choice if you have a mobile hotspot with unlimited data. You can now bring Alexa on the go.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've purchased this tablet for myself, my boys (10 and 18) and my nephew (16). It's perfect for everybody!\n",
      "Positive :-> It was easy to install. Provides amusement and entertainment every day.\n",
      "Positive :-> I enjoy reading ebooks on this tablet as well as watching videos. It's just so handy to carry around in my purse.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great tablet for kids or if you just want something to mess around on\n",
      "Positive :-> Best purchase I've made in a while. This thing is fun for the whole family, really came in handy with the recent storms we had. Every night is a movie night with this\n",
      "Positive :-> like the on request weather and traffic. Music selection with prime is very good\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon free time is very kid friendly. My 2 year old uses it with ease. Tons of kid apps for all ages\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product a like a lot .works perfect in any tv\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as gift for daughter and son-in-law. It was easy to set up and has worked perfectly. It's been a lot of fun so I'm going to get one for myself!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my kindle. Silk is a fast and easy way to access the webI can read books on my kindle anywhere once I download them to my kindle. I have over 300 books on the Cloud. It holds a charge for days when idle. Downside. Hard to read outside due to glare\n",
      "Positive :-> I have one and like it so much that I purchased one for my son. It can be used for entertainment or to control a smart home.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is fun and easy. No longer do you need to walk to the device or use a remote!\n",
      "Positive :-> amazing tab for a gift. right priced and the performance is great. it is really helpful for browsing and basic activities\n",
      "Positive :-> It does almost all the things the more expensive Kindles do for a lot less $. Screen resolution is decent and it is a nice e reader.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice and easy on the eyes, lightweight. What I take on trips to read outside or at home anytime.\n",
      "Positive :-> It works great. We are using it to play pandora music all day at the store. So far, we don't have any issue. It works very consistently.\n",
      "Positive :-> I just upgraded from a Touch to a Voyage and could not be happier. In my opinion this is by far the best Kindle yet. Its operation and features are similar to the Touch and Paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very comfortable in the hand. Like other e-ink devices (unlike Fire) the screen has a matte finish which is really superb for reading. Some early reviews I've read complained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue. I have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully has been corrected. The built-in screen light is amazing.Like other e-ink devices the Voyage allows better control and integration of dictionaries, which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to consult several dictionaries in-situ to fully understand a word or phrase.There is very little not to like about the Voyage. I can only think of two issues to consider:1. Price - no doubt about it, Voyage is expensive, but in my opinion it is worth it. When trading off price and performance, I urge you to go into your nearest Best Buy for a hands-on look at the various Kindles, particularly the Paperwhite and Voyage to see what you really need/want or can live with.2. A minor point for the evolution of e-ink readers: it would be nice if there was some control of the screen background color or at least an implementation of a warmer background. Recent studies suggest adverse effects, particularly regarding getting good sleep, from using electronic devices with bright-white or bluish screens (disrupts melatonin production in the body). This is one (of the few in my opinion) advantages of Kindle Fire and Kindle for Android, where several text background colors are available).I highly recommend Voyage - the new king of e-readers.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great buy and good starter for a smart home if you got all accessories\n",
      "Positive :-> I highly recommend the Amazon Echo. The range of information and music are fun and help keep me up on current events.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is amazing. And who can beat the price. Features and apps work well as well as touch sensitivity\n",
      "Positive :-> My grand children love kids tablets and play with them every day and their mother is using them to teach the kids\n",
      "Positive :-> Spend the extra money on this vs just a fire stick\n",
      "Positive :-> There is nothing better than a Paperwhite for reading and the new one is just great - clear, clean and quick.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my new colored kindle. I can do anything I want with this one. I used to have the old kindle so wanted to upgrade. Great choice\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the voice control and functions. Need to download more apps. Want to purchase the lights to go with it. Never talks back to you.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had no problems so far, pretty good tablet for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to navigate, love the features! Just wish the price was lower!\n",
      "Neutral :-> The tablet is great for only $50 but certainly not the most touch responsive. It feels a little slow to me. It also irked me that you have to pay extra to remove the ads from the lock screen.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa did not powerful as Siri of Apple. It can not play YouTube. It is very limit to play music. It is required to open some accounts to play music.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works good for a cheap tablet to have around work and not worry about. Freezes occasionally but not a big deal for the cost.\n",
      "Positive :-> My grandkids wanted this for obvious reasons and when I saw it go on sale on BB, I jumped at the chance and bought it. The kids love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Expandable memory up to 128gb. Amazon kindle/prime benefits. Small portable options with stylish accessories from a name brand as opposed to some unknown Chinese alternative. I choose Amazon everyday of every week at this price point.\n",
      "Positive :-> The item is a great tablet for basic uses such as email, youtube, and facebook.\n",
      "Positive :-> This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient.....\n",
      "Positive :-> I'mSuper happy with the echo from Amazon. It's my new best friend. :)\n",
      "Positive :-> Works well...is a lot of value for the money. Very happy!\n",
      "Positive :-> Performs much better than our old Roku and the Firestick! Seems to be way faster, much clearer w/ no buffering issues. I just wish it came with a qwerty keyboard.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a neat gadget; can do some things like track items for a shopping list and setting timers that are great. I would have expected it to be better at telling me things like when is TV show X on and what sound does a Cardinal (bird) make. All were met with \"I didn't understand the question.\" Alexa should be more intuitive than that and should learn and grow as you go along, she does not. You also have to ask things in a way Alexa will understand. For example, you cannot say, \"Alexa, turn out the lights in the kitchen.\" That \"does not compute.\" But if you say, \"Alexa, shut off the lights.\" She will do as you ask. I had to start writing down the \"correct\" way to ask her things so I would remember them. Again she needs to learn and adapt; not happening so far.\n",
      "Positive :-> They love it from the kids. I have this by myself it is really good I would buy it for anyone\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is fantastic, she is helpful, excellent voice recognition, it can help with many tasks. My home is smart because of Alexa. I recommended this product.\n",
      "Positive :-> like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product allows me to save over a hundred dollars on my cable bill.\n",
      "Positive :-> Obviously doesn't support everything out there but it's fast and does what I need it to\n",
      "Positive :-> I got this for my mother as a gift. She absolutely loves it. She was wanting a small, cheap tablet and this fit her needs.\n",
      "Positive :-> Well worth the $50 for a nice tablet. It fits the bill. Nice display, no frills.\n",
      "Positive :-> Ok I purchased this tablet specifically for my two year old for her birthday. So far she loves it but gets tired of the kids included amazon trial videos. So I end up logging into my user account for her to be able to go on YouTube. But she really likes and enjoys her new tablet. Over all it's a good tablet for kids. What had me on purchasing this tablet was the free no question asked replacement warranty. She has dropped it many times but the included foam case has protected the tablet every time.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet as a gift for my granddaughter to play games on. It is very easy for her to use and it is just the right size.\n",
      "Positive :-> Have several echo's throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well. Have noticed that I usually have to yell for Alexa to hear me but that may have to do with the acoustics in the garage. Other than that it works well.\n",
      "Positive :-> Can't say enough good things about this product. Very happy with the way that Alexa integrates into my life. Well designed and well executed. I'm waiting for Amazon Dot's to put around my home.\n",
      "Positive :-> Really enjoying this baby kindle! My first experience with a Kindle product. Fits in my purse even in folio. Recommend a stylus. Having fun loading it up with books, videos, music, and apps. Use it for email and facebook, internet searches, etc. I don't have a smart phone so this is really handy. And, hey, it has TWO cameras, too!!! For $50--UNBELIEVABLE!!! At this price, I could have one in every room of my house!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great way to listen to music and great questions answered.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for the price, but that's not it! The interface is clean as ipad and but there is limitation in app stores. Initially I tried to use this Fire tablet to cast videos to my TV which has the Chromecast embedded. I have not figured out how I can do it. Beautiful display, easy transition from my paperwhite, connected easily to my wifi. I haven't done much yet except read books. It looks so pretty! TANGERINE is so pretty! Good Price as well!\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a gift and they love it so much that I think I will get more\n",
      "Positive :-> I like the tablet. We got it for my nephew who is 5. He can easily use it daily. He has a lot of educational games downloaded and it stays charged for awhile.\n",
      "Positive :-> I upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet. Works great and does everything I need it to do.\n",
      "Positive :-> this is a good product for daily use, we like it till now.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have had each of the models released and this current one with the 300 ppi is the best so far. Reading screen is excellent. Fonts are crisp and clear.\n",
      "Positive :-> It serves the purpose and kid is happy with it. It can be used for kindle reading too.\n",
      "Positive :-> The product is good for children. The downside is, the tablet's charging port will get loose and not function anymore within the first month of use. If you plan on giving this to a child, make sure you take care of charging it for them, dont let them do it on their own, or they will most likely mess up the port even quicker as they are a bit careless.\n",
      "Positive :->  \n",
      "Positive :-> Now I know amazon prices their tablets at their manufacturing price (ie. The price it costs them to make it). They do this because they hope to make more profit off of purchases made on the device then they would having it be a competitive tablet on the market. Other tablets may have better specs but I bought this as a second 'around the house' tablet. And it does its job very well. Picture quality is more than enjoyable, the screen is bright, colors are vibrant, there's a built in blue light filter for nightime viewing (I love this feature because most apps for this are buggy or have adds). The expandable storage is very desirable especially if you like to download ebooks or lots of media. Amazon's app store has an 'underground' feature so a lot of paid apps in the Google or samsung stores are free to download here. They have free cloud storage connected to your amazon account so if your space is low you can free up space without loosing items. This also means if you want to transfer items between devices it's no probbem at all. They have a reading library that gives you access to many popular titles for a monthly fee or the bookstore itself has many free or very affordable books aswell with no monthly fee. This device can \"mirror\" a different kindle tablet so if you are replacing an old tablet it you can easily load all settings and apps onto your new one. Also, over the years amazon has been doing free updates for devices to make them run the current os. This is a nice feature when it comes to always having the newest technology, but from what I can tell it is not optional. My old tablet ran with the black carousel type os but was automatically updated overnight to the current (more visually pleasing) os. It did give me many notices stating when the update would happen and added that it would only work if the device was connected to wifi. It may be something to keep in mind if this bothers you. Overall I like this tablet very much and it is a bargin for what you're getting.\n",
      "Positive :-> I wasn't expecting much for the price but I really enjoy using it. I mainly play games on this device. I would totally recommend this device to anyone.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Use it all the time. Simple to set up and start using.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my first kindle, and I am using it to read, play a few games, although not really a gamer. Over all I am really liking this kindle. Great deal too.\n",
      "Positive :-> For the longest time I had been using a Kindle Keyboard which was good for its time until the 3rd gen. Paperwhite came along. The decision was a no brainer especially with the 300 dpi lighted screen and at the same reasonable price. I've gotten used to using the touch screen compared to the physical turn page buttons although every now and then the screen should be wiped to remove oils from our skin that accumulate. There is always something for everyone in the Kindle store\n",
      "Positive :-> Gave this as a gift. My friend liked the tablet and it is pretty inexpensive. The only problem is that flixster app is no longer available/compatible with Amazon so, she is not able to watch movies she owns on flixster.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is great for ur tv if an amazon customer. Only thing Alexa needs improvements!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I use mine for email, Facebook ,games and to go on line. I also have down loaded books. I use it to take photos. It is small and be taken easily. I would recommend it to anyone .\n",
      "Positive :-> Our Amazon Echo is another step toward making life easier. As a senior member of society, sitting back and having a \"conversation\" to learn about news, time, weather, etc. is even easier than finding the remote. Relaxing with music I can just \"request\" is always a good deal. And, not to mention the potential for the summoning of medical services in emergency situations. A great investment.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to install has everything that I need and more!!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> This model has an excellent screen resolution and size. Very easy to use and navigate the functions. Web browser works great. The backlight is super helpful and does great in the sun for outdoor reading. It's small and lightweight size make it easy for me to carry in my purse. I would recommend this to anyone\n",
      "Positive :-> The perfect tablet for a beginner. Also at the super low price its hard to find a better bargain.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is so compact and fit in my purse. It works very well.\n",
      "Positive :-> The service and shopping experience was great. The products are amazing.\n",
      "Positive :-> I would definitely recommend. It's great for every day use.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great product from concept to execution and constantly expanding functionality and capability!Also, very unexpected sound quality from this little tube! IMPRESSIVE!\n",
      "Positive :-> Had to buy two for each kid of mine. They absolutely love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really enjoy the amazon tablet for paying my bills online and looking up recipes.\n",
      "Positive :-> My soul purpose for buying this item was to read which I am completely satisfied for it, howevef, the camera quality isn't of great quality\n",
      "Positive :-> Excelente.\n",
      "Positive :-> The tablets that I purchased have worked great for their purpose. Only problem I have is a couple glitches I keep running into. It's frozen up twice. I end up having to wait til it dies to restart it. Kinda sucks but other than that, my kids love it and I'm happy.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought as a gift for a person's first tablet. They love it. Easy to use and as many popular apps as any other devices. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome! My cousin had one and I loved it So much that I bought one for my husband and sister. Good features and easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> The device itself is good designed.I'm Amazon prime member, but found that the amazon prime video/tv isn't that good. Can't find many good video to watch.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire TV from Amazon works great! I have cancelled cable TV and am watching movies, news, football and etc. via Sling and the Fire TV. Takes some getting used to, but I would highly recommend if you want to save money on your cable bill and still enjoy TV.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my second kindle. The first one stopped holding a charge. I don't know if that is a problem with the Kindle or not but I still love my Kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> Loved this tablet before. Happier now with lower price and expandable memory.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Cheap functional tablet, slower than most if not all latest smartphones.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to set up and works great with hue lighting!!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great over the top device. The Alexa integration is a major plus.\n",
      "Neutral :-> it can answer very easy questions, but anything more advanced it does not understand. You have to be very specific, for example you can ask whats in a martini, but you cant ask how do I make a martini. Its got room for improvement.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for the price. I already have 3 followers including the hd.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great streaming device with awesome games. Alexa works great\n",
      "Positive :-> I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like being able to just tell Echo to play music, or asking for the weather. Also works great with general questions. Only thing I'm not too happy with is it sometimes picks up what the TV is saying and attempts to do something with it. Looking forward to adding smart devices to the house and integrating Echo with all of that.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great android tablet. On top of it on black friday it is 34.99$ i bought a couple for my son.They abuse it and it is well worth having a backup and it is so cheap you can afford to break a couple.You can side load google appstore, just google it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Echo at a discount when combined with a Logitec Harmony remote. I now can operate my AV system just by telling Alexa what I want it to do. Pretty cool! I also use it to listen to Pandora and get my news at the beginning of the day. It is capable of much more but I am happy with what it does for now.\n",
      "Positive :-> At the price of $39 you can't go wrong. Great mobile device that is bigger than trying to use phone.\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased the Fire Table for an elderly person birthday. They love it and is on the internet all the time reading news articles. The Fire Tablet is a good gift item.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works great, easy to use. Battery holds charge good. Just the right size.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle Paperwhite is an awesome alternative to a paperback book. Great reading and lighting in all angles and lighting conditions. Price is great compared to similar devices. Great at what its designed for - I highly recommend if you want a dedicated reading tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Better performance and clarity than the Amazon fire stick.\n",
      "Positive :-> Trying Apple TV for the first time. I love it! Can't wait to try out all the apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> I thought this would have a better sound than the Google Home Assistant based on price ($50 more when not on sale) and description of speaker. Ran the two side by side and I thought the Google Home had a better sound. Neither one is a main speaker in my room but sometimes it is easier to just ask them to play a station on Pandora or Radio than going to the main sound system. As for what Alexa can and can't do...that is tough to say since we don't have any smart devices in the house at that moment. It works well for quick weather, news and traffic reports but not so good for a free-form question. Google was more intuitive and better at understanding the question. With Alexa, if you have not downloaded the \"skill\" then there is a chance that she won't understand. Still, she is very good at keeping track of shopping lists and at some point I will add smart lights, thermostats, garage door opener, etc. to the house so hopefully the convenience will make things better.\n",
      "Positive :-> My granddaughter really loves it. She was so anxious to start using it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this device to stream movies and shows online!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice to have a charger that works quickly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great for night reading. No bright light to hurt eyes.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for lil brother its a ok tablet for a kid especially apps like WWE and cartoon\n",

      "Positive :-> Love it... quality is great. Love your interactive it is..\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this tablet as a secondary one and I'm happy with the ease of use and fairly quick internet usage. You can't beat the price for what it gives you and it's also feels sturdy when holding it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I used to read books off my iPad but I love the Kindle so much more. Easier on my eyes, easier to take with me when I travel, overall so much better for reading!\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price\n",

      "Positive :-> I would recommend this to anyone that loves watching movies.\n",
      "Positive :-> I dearly love my Alexa, She is able to give me the latest weather update. along with other very useful commands. Plus she can make me laugh on a regular basis.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to use and simple tablet. For the money can't go wrong.\n",
      "Positive :-> Reading on the voyage is such a pleasure. Its so much more convenient than carrying around an actual book. I love that I can read in bed without disturbing my partner. The backlight makes reading a pleasure whether in the dark or outside in the sun. Truly well worth the price if you are a serious reader. I love having several books available so I never run out of reading material while at the doctors or on a plane......\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought 2 for our grand kids Great price and very good graphics\n",
      "Positive :-> Works Perfect and woujld highly recommend.Was easy to set up!\n",

      "Positive :-> Does what we need it to. Able to download apps that make it fun.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa works fine but has trouble wit questions that requires search on the web. I have mine connected to a Smartthings Hub and for the most part they work well together. Alexa has trouble running some of the automations.\n",
      "Positive :-> there were so many movies to pick from and also so many tv shows to watch all in great quality.\n",
      "Positive :-> I am able to see my Directv, Netflix, and amazon prime all in one system.\n",
      "Positive :-> Cool little device that tells you almost anything you want to know. Music sounds good as well!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my wife for her birthday. She is a huge music buff. This thing makes me wonder if I will ever buy music again. Tell it to play anything and it will. It's worth a purchase for this reason alone and it does so much more. Awesome buy\n",
      "Positive :-> the amazon fire tablet is a fantastic deal for the price. the amazon app store is great and this tablet has speed and a great screen for the price point you can't go wrong\n",
      "Positive :-> With an amazon prime membership you have \"Alexa\" play all kinds of music. Haven't really used any of the other features yet.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product for playing games and watching movies on the go.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an excellent device and easy to use. 5 stars if you have Amazon Prime and want to use what's included with Prime. But if you don't have Prime, any Android TV Box would be better at half the cost.\n",
      "Positive :-> Portable, good battery life, easy to read in pretty much any light. It doesn't have all the frills like the Kindle Fire, but if all you're looking to do is read, this is what you need.\n",
      "Positive :-> If, like I, you own an earlier generation Kindle that isn't a Paperwhite, this latest model is WELL WORTH THE UPGRADE.If you don't, it's like having a wider but really no thicker or heavier iPhone 6 Plus to read your Kindle app books (and to use Goodreads) on outdoors. (It even has Airplane Mode.)It had me at its crisp, crisp backlit display and quick response to touch. (I had to really press vs. tap on the older Kindle, and it was so slow to take/load.)\n",
      "Positive :-> The Fire TV is a wonderful device. I have the Stick and I think that the TV is much better.\n",
      "Positive :-> I needed to upgrade from the orginal Kindle fire and this Fire works great. Videos,games, email and battery life all are great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very enjoyable and easy for listening to music selections online. It sounds very good for it's size.\n",
      "Positive :-> Simple to use and setup for a 2 years old toddler.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is really good if you read a lot, doesn't strain your eyes and very light weight. Only demerit is - cant use in night if there is not enough light.\n",
      "Positive :-> This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy set up, fun to use and sound quality is surprisingly good in our large open area.\n",
      "Positive :-> Switched from AppleTV to Fire TV and absolutely love it. Speedy, lots of capabilities due to Android OS.\n",
      "Positive :-> This reader is great for consuming your digital media on the go. With a few tweaks it is quite a function tablet for cheap.\n",
      "Positive :-> Saw quite a few youtube videos on this product and thought it would be fun to have. We have it downstairs in a split level house and keep it downstairs. We should probably buy another one to keep upstairs! Works great. Voice recognition is superb. We use it to check traffic, play Pandora stations and answer various questions. Don't have any home automation stuff yet, but that may be next!\n",
      "Positive :-> We use it for the music mostly and love it. The kids play games and enjoy it\n",
      "Positive :-> Love mine so far for reading. Good price and super easy to use.\n",
      "Positive :-> I got it for my brother and he loved it! He loved how small the box is and how it doesn't take to much space.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my third kindle and is the best by far. The smaller size is great because it fits nicely in my purse so I never leave home without it. Other great features are page turning, adjusting light and weight.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my kindle fire. It is a big upgrade from the kindle keyboard that i used to have.\n",

      "Positive :-> So happy with my purchase easy to setup and request information, music and anything\n",
      "Positive :-> Just using this for music so it does what I need it to do. Would give 5 stars but it falls asleep faster than I would like it to.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome tablet! Super quick, great picture, and overall great quality\n",
      "Positive :-> I use this for music and for creating lists or for finding out what is going on in the world. I also use it to control other smart devices. Still elarning and it does have a little bit of a way to go to be really useful.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great light weight tablet that uploads quickly. Would recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> Must have if you have Amazon Prime. Easy to set up and easy to use.\n",

      "Positive :-> really good charger\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as a gift for my 4 year old grandson. I took it out and set it up for hime before giving it to him. He refuses to put it down. I would recommend buying a very good case with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my 8 yr old niece, she loves it. Also bought a screen shield & a 'kid proof' case. However, neither stopped the screen from cracking the first time she dropped it. At least it was only $50 :/My nephew has an 1st gen iPad Air, w a kid case; he's dropped it many times, the screen is fine. You get what you pay for.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for a young kid so that she would be able to have her own device to play games on. She's been extremely happy and we haven't encountered any issues or problems with her being able to use it.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 2yr old daughter loves it! Perfect Xmas gift!\n",
      "Positive :-> Very nice table, for a very good price. Very good for reading, browsing, and basic functions.A little slow overall. And I also miss some better features related to the different profiles we can create. For example, we can create different profiles for kids, but can't put a password to each one of them (at least, I didn't find how to do it).\n",

      "Positive :-> I bought the Fire for a second tv as I already have one and like it. I bought the Fire because I am a Prime member.\n",
      "Positive :-> I returned the item because itt was not wireless. It always needed to be plugged in in order to work. Otherwise it was a great product. I was looking for something that could be taken from level to level as well as outside with ease.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love it I am still trying to figure out all its skills but everyday is a surprise.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this as an upgrade from my old Kindle. Works awesome, i can even watch movies through my Amazon Prime. Plenty of apps to choose from. Awesome little tablet.\n",

      "Positive :-> Enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. Initially disappointed by the small size, but I quickly learned to appreciate it. Very portable and convenient. I wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3G connection so I did not have to be connected to WIFI to download books. Was a bit more then I wanted to pay but feel I will get good use out of it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my tablet. I'm not used to using amazon but its good now\n",

      "Positive :-> This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was an early adoptor of the Amazon Echo, when I heard they were releasing a mobile version I wanted it. It wasn't until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how usefule this lil guy was, just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function Echo.

      "Positive :-> Great tablet at a very good price, it works for everyone in the house from downloading apps/games to reading.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Kindle10 is OK, but a bit confusing to figure out. I do love the larger screen since I need to increase the text size. However, I did find a book that does explain the Kindle10 version on Amazon.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great design, decent remote, 4k support, tons of app support, ethernet support, I love it!\n",

      "Positive :-> I bought the Fire for myself and it is user friendly. We put some games on it about 1 yr later for my daughter and she actually can navigate it pretty good. So we bought her her own Fire which she is proud to be able to listen to music and play simple games.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had used Roku, Nvidia Shield, Apple TV and Smart TV's digital feed. This device does the heavy lifting effortlessly, at $100.00 price point and allows the versitility of android tv customization.The Apple and Android Smart Phone Remote app trumps all the others.Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is great. She plays music for me, tells me the news, tells me jokes, reminds me to get to my appointments. She sometimes misinterprets my requests. She's not perfect. She helps me with yoga.\n",

      "Positive :-> Purchased this as a gift for my father and he's loving it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Most definitely worth the money. I bought the fire tv box after owning a firestick and it is a great device especially if you are an amazon prime member. Twice the speed of the firestick with availability to add external hard drives and memory cards. Bluetooth enables you to add keyboards and game controllers if you wish. Also has an ethernet port so you don't have to use WiFi. I absolutely love it and if I had the choice I would buy a fire tv box rather than a firestick.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product and will definitely share to all my friends\n",

      "Positive :-> I really like the echo but I am still trying to find out what else it can do for me. I do plan on getting the controllable lights and thermostat down the road but in the mean time it is still limited. Overall great idea.\n",
      "Positive :-> With Amazon Fire TV, you can access thousands of movies and TV shows instantly. Find favorites quickly or access weather and sports updates using the Alexa voice search...\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two Amazon Echo's at their deal of the day price! We love using them. Great service and product!\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle fire is excellent device I personally have one as do all of my children at this point\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome tablet for young children. They love to play all the videos that it came equipped with already on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love that I can have the convenience of my laptop and my games in a small tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> It makes reading at night much easier. Easy access to books that are of interest.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet for general use. Easy to add apps. Good battery lifetime.\n",
      "Positive :-> We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.\n",
      "Positive :-> Absolutely makes my home feel more updated. I use her to control all of my lights and TV's\n",
      "Positive :-> This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad.\n",
      "Positive :-> Overall, this tablet is great for kids and adults. It's not overpriced and you can do a lot with it. Including, browsing the web, downloading paid or free apps, downloading books free or paid, listening to music, shopping right through amazon, storing files, and plenty more. I wouldn't trade this tablet for any other.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price for a starter tablet. Easy to use and able to watch video and read books. Only downfall is poor external speaker if not using headphones.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've only had this for about a week now, but I love it and I love that I can set this up in my kitchen, and hear it throughout my entire house (even upstairs). It makes easy/ convenient for entertaining, playing music while cleaning the house and being \"hands- free\".I do wish it didn't require the monthly amazon music fee to play more music choices but it still has a wide range of music without the account.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really like this - Great product and with a few work arounds fits great into the Apple Ecosystem!\n",
      "Positive :-> A friend had an Amazon Echo and my wife loved it. I surprised her with one for her birthday. She uses it everyday for weather, news and music. Great device and easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> Have you considered buying a kindle for your kids? This is the one to get. Anything else and you're over spending. Pros:Great app selectionGreat free apps due to UndergroundExtremely affordableSD card supportCons:Bad storage management - when you run out of internal space, the device stops functioning correctly!\n",
      "Positive :-> Great tablet for the price. It is very clear to use and it responds well.\n",
      "Positive :-> First time I've purchased this and found it excellent\n",
      "Positive :-> We really enjoy it. Bought it to watch our slingbox but we have found tons of extra content that we really enjoy\n",
      "Positive :-> A friend told me about this product and it was a great deal!\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon fire is a good size to carry about and easy to use.You can do so much with it just like a small computer as wellAs being an e-reader. Excellent buy\n",
      "Positive :-> I've had a couple different Kindles & have also tried to read books on my iPad & phone. LOVE the Kindle Paperwhite. You can read it outside in the sun, by the pool, on your deck etc... & the print is always clear & visible. The battery stays charged for several days & it's small size makes it easy to carry in your purse or tote bag!\n",
      "Neutral :-> Not bad,but returned it and bought a dot to go with my soundtouch 20. Would recommend this if your not fussy about your music.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have been using the Amazon Echo for a few weeks now, I have to say its much more responsive then the Google Home when using home automation. A must have for any home.\n",
      "Positive :-> the only bad thing I could come up with would be the battery doesn't last that long. otherwise this tablet is great for the money does everything an apple does and can add to the memory witch is fantastic.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to configure, works as expected, easy to download books\n",
      "Positive :-> Small enough to make it portable, a lot faster then the Stick.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great reader. Bought it for my wife and she loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this for my 3 year old due to it having the bumper and I will tell you it's well worth it. I couldn't tell you how many times its been dropped and survives every time.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy and convenient way to always have a book with you to read.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product does what it is supposed to with no problems!\n",
      "Positive :-> This Fire TV is a better choice than the Fire Stick from a connectivity standpoint if you have a LAN connection or if you have potential wireless connections. It also has the advantage of expandable storage, although I've not found a need for it yet. As with the newest Apple TV, the Fire TV uses a graphic intensive interface. Although the Fire TV doesn't have the Apple's volume control, selection is somewhat more reliable than the touch pad interface used by Apple. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the way Amazon chooses to organize the selections. All in all, the Fire TV is the best way to take advantage of your Amazon Prime Membership.\n",
      "Positive :-> Received my new kindle in perfect condition and I am very happy it is faster and a clearer it has a. bigger had drive at a good price and a fast delivery that you can count on you can not go wrongThank you\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an excellent tablet to have if you aren't looking to spend too much. Doesn't have tons of features, however, it has the main basics: music, web browsing, email, video/movies, gaming, and reading. Plus, if your an Amazon Prime member, you can get great games for free like Real Racing 3, and DuckTales. Also, great as a young child's tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he's used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on.\n",
      "Positive :-> After rooting and placing play store on it I liked it more. Not bad for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good of a steal almost 50% off, not the best tablet but good for the price\n",
      "Positive :-> Lady had been looking for one of these since Xmas and found one. And loves it\n",
      "Positive :-> This device is OK for reading or listening to audiobooks via Overdrive app. Wouldn't recommend it though really. Waited to buy Kindle for years. Would suggest doing research before buying this device.\n",
      "Positive :-> needed this for a 5 year old to play games and watch movies, and it is a great fit for the $$$\n",
      "Positive :-> This case is sturdy and will stand upright so that you can watch a video or read a book hands free. It fits easily in my purse, not bulky at all. The only bad thing is that the case only comes in a dark ugly color. ****** should offer at least one other color, preferably a light color.\n",
      "Positive :-> Fast, solid, all the necessary features for an ebook. I like the side pressure page advance and the small size fits my small hands.\n",
      "Positive :-> Only got four stars because it's got to many preloaded apps I can not hide and I got this tab for my seven year old for Christmas. She loves it though and it works great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa is like my personal assistant. She does it all! And keeps me company when I'm bored. Still learning new features but this is the coolest thing I've bought for myself in a long time!\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my husband for Christmas, it's easy to use and light weight. I'm still using a first gen Kindle Fire and after playing with his I wish I bought one for myself too! It has many features an Android phone would have.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good for price. One should not expect the quality of iPad from this product\n",
      "Positive :-> MY STUDENTS ENJOY USING THIS PRODUCT FOR LEARNING .\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought it to help with cutting the cord. I use it mostly to access PlayStation vue service and it works great. If i were a amazon prime member i imagine it would be great to access the prime content. The fire box allows for direct wire to the modem and loads faster than the fire stick which is wifi only.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's a really good tablet for kids my kids love them\n",
      "Positive :-> For it's price point, this is a great little tablet. As long as your not looking for something to do everything, you'll be happy. This was given as a gift and the recipient was very happy with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was a gift for my son he enjoys it very much.\n",
      "Positive :-> I use the echo to control the lights and thermostat in the house. Syncs with other devices really easy and has a ton of other function.\n",
      "Positive :-> I had receive an Echo Dot as a present. Its only real weakness was that it was not a good enough sound quality for music. I messed around with external speakers by Blutooth and hard wired, nothing was convenient.. The sound quality on the Echo is good enough for casual listening of music and news.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've previously owned a Nook and Ipad. This eReader is by far the best. The instant dictionary is a plus. Excellent for reading in bright or low light conditions. Easy out of the box set up. No complaints!\n",
      "Positive :-> I particularly like the fact that the text shows up and you can see it well outside on a sunny day. I use it with Kindle Unlimited.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product has great sound quality and easy to use. I love it and have given it as a gift twice now.\n",
      "Positive :-> Picked this up for a 7 year old. I'm used to using iPads, but not a bad little tablet for a kid and Im not worried if if something happens to it.\n",
      "Positive :-> This gives me so many app and avenues to watch and stream directly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product if you love to read!!! I use it all the time. Love that I can read in the dark with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the echo. Purchased for my mother in law for Christmas. We have had our own for about a year now.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for our 2 year old son, has really helped with his vocabulary\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this to fill my life with music. The first two weeks were fantastic. I got Amazon Music, and needed only to say, \"Alexa, play (insert artist name, song name, or album name)\" and it would play music. The speaker quality is great. 4 days after Christmas it went into a Christmas Music and hymn default. Whatever artist I requested, it would play the first song, and then default to religious music. I'd switch artists and it'd happen again. I contacted Amazon, and was told not to request artists. I needed to specify albums and songs. I don't have this info memorized. I bought it to say artist names. Someone responding to my poor review on Amazon suggested trying different music services. I dumped Amazon music and started requesting music on Pandora. Alexa misunderstood my granddaughters request, and played Christmas music on Pandora, although we were now well into Jan. I'm no longer having the Christmas music problem, but Alexa is just ok playing music from Pandora. Sometimes it gets it right, sometimes not. I am so disappointed in it, that I plug it in when I want to hear music, and unplug it, and ignore it most of the time. When it worked the first two weeks, I raved about it. After witnessing my problems, people who come over don't want one.\n",
      "Positive :-> No more cable bills - I get all I need with it !!!\n",
      "Positive :-> I am satisfied with my purchase, I really recommend this item\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon Fire for Kids is an excellent starter tablet. The supporting games and apps are exceptional. Use of tablet is simple and non-intimidating.\n",
      "Positive :-> I received this as a gift and love it. It can do so many things I have to give it a 9/10!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a good beginning tablet. Works well and has lots of preloaded apps to start you off.\n",
      "Positive :-> I can't figure out how to use without switching out the hd1 plugs continuously .\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my kindle, makes reading at night so easy and it feels like you are reading a real book.\n",
      "Positive :-> The picture is crystal clear. The resolution is amazing given the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now I've resisted moving to electronic media when reading for pleasure. Now I wish I hadn't waited so long. Reading at night with the lights off and instantly downloading a new book are my favorite aspects.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very easy to set up. Just plug in and ask her questions. Haven't used parental controls so can't say anything about that.\n",
      "Positive :-> I tried the Roku but the Fire TV was just more flexible and the menu was easier to navigate.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price. Great product. Best product for the money.\n",
      "Positive :-> i bought this for my 4yr old sister and a 32gb memorystick to put all her movies on it and it works great, but you have to find a app that plays it since the install one was a little hard to use for a kid\n",
      "Positive :-> Great price great product would recommend this gift\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my dad to watch Netflix, and it works very well. Easy to use, which is a bonus\n",
      "Positive :-> It's good for toddlers. Would recommend to another parent.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really like the Amazon Fire 7\" Tablet. I would recommend it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend\n",
      "Positive :-> I have several echo dots around my home, but this makes it easier for me to carry into a room that doesn't have one and control things around the house, listen to the news or music. It holds a great charge.\n",
      "Negative :-> This is a competent tablet at a bargain price. Unfortunately it is crippled by a useless operating system. Amazon's take on Android essentially removes all functionality that makes Android great, to force you to use their services and apps INSTEAD of Google's.If you're a tinkerer or don't mind doing some software hacking, this is a pretty easy fix. You can hack Google's apps and services back into it, resulting in an amazing, and amazingly cheap Android tablet.Unless you're willing to do, or hire someone to do, those software modifications, you'll probably be disappointed. If you are, it'll be the best cheap tablet you'll ever own.It looks like it might be great for kids, even in its stock state. I don't have kids, so I could not test that. But I added a star for that possibility.Unmodified: 2 starsModified: 5 stars\n",
      "Neutral :-> Its ok for the price if willing to deal with the ads and cant download certain apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 4 year old loves it. The amazon free time is great a lot of apps free for a small yearly fee.\n",
      "Positive :-> My wife and I have been trying to decide between the Paperwhite and the new Nook for a while. After checking each out, the Paperwhite was definitely a clear winner. Amazon support + unique features = a newfound interest in reading!\n",
      "Positive :-> Before you spend a lot if money on a high end tablet for your kids, try this one. Great value!\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter loves her tablet it works really good.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like my ECHO, she however will talk on her own sometime. Still getying used to it. We mainly use it fir the bluetooth so we can play mudic from Pandora and Youtube.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have one of the very early versions of the Kindle and the Kindle Paper-White is so much more compact. That makes it really great for travel. I also love the self-recharging capability.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon - Echo is not just an amazing sound device but offers an always improved upon array of innovative services. My Best Buy for the year so far.\n",
      "Positive :-> First and foremost the Echo is a good Bluetooth/connected speaker. It's no Sonos but I wasn't expecting it to be. It's really cool to ask her questions like you would a real person and get some good results. \"When is the cubs game/how are they doing\" and \"What are show times for Star Trek: Beyond\" yielded great results. To be honest though that novelty while very good and consistent wears off a little. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't invested in smart home tech because that is where the Echo shines. I currently have an Ecobee3, Phillips Hue, Sonos, August lock, and Harmony Hub. Right now the Echo works with Hue, Sonos, and Ecobee3 with the Harmony Hub being tested currently. There is no way to make the August work but there are ways to make other things work using apps like IFTT and Yonomi. I suggest anyone who wants one of these google those two apps to see some of the amazing things you can do with this awesome little device. I can turn on and off my lights, turn on and off my different activities with Harmony, play music, lower or raise the temperature and get basic info off the web. It's really cool and we are closer to Star Trek than ever. It is worth the money if you want to talk to your house. I love it. There are some failings. It doesn't understand some complex wordy questions while others it has no problem with. The list of compatible devices are limited but with those two apps I spoke of, IFTT and Yonomi that list is greatly increased, and the \"skills' you can get aren't good at all. Limited and poor. But the potential is there and it looks like Amazon is working on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased this for my 3yr old and he loved it. No problems once so ever. For the price it was a still.\n",
      "Negative :-> I loved everything about my kindle paperwhite but then while reading the other night I swiped to turn the page and nothing happened. It froze after using it for about two years, give or take a couple of months. I've tried restarting it but it does not shut off. I advise you also buy the extended two year warranty or just go back to reading real books.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids are growing out of their ipod touch and I wanted to get them something bigger. The kindle fire tablet is such a great deal so it was a no brainer to get all three of my kids one.\n",
      "Positive :-> For 7 year old. Now has two in different colors - can tell what is on which one by color.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was hesitant at first, but now I love it. I love turning the lights off/on with my echo.\n",
      "Positive :-> Grandson loves his new tablet. Had to set him up as an adult because Amazon had too many restrictions for child account\n",
      "Positive :-> Got 2 of these for Christmas gifts for our grandsons & they love them!\n",
      "Positive :-> I went back to buy two more for a nephews and aunt.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet for my baby.keeps him busy. I love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Took sometime to learn all the things it can do. Very easy to set up.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great streaming device based on Android which makes it somewhat customizable.\n",
      "Positive :-> I'VE had other kindles and when my current ones storage became low I knew I wanted to purchase another one. It can be used for a variety of uses.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very happy with the Amazon echo So happy I went and bought another one\n",
      "Positive :-> The paper white screen is so easy to read in dark and light conditions. I read in bed before going to sleep and the screen brightness is low enough that it doesn't affect your melatonin production so it won't interfere with your sleep cycles. I used to use a tablet but it was too bright and bulky.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love this. This is the best e-reader I have owned. Even thought it has ads it is not a big deal because that can easily be fixed to get rid of the ads on it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product. We have fun talking to our new \" friend.\" Daughter love the stories from the echo app. Very useful and it is used daily. Highly suggested.\n",
      "Positive :-> Gave the Amazon Echo for my grandson for Christmas. He is still excited about all of its features. He talks about how good it is and want it does all the time.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good tablet for kids. Lots of appts to download for games\n",
      "Positive :-> Do not pay attention to their ad. It says the plug is not included with the kindle and it absolutely is. If they lie about this sort of thing what else do you think the lie about. Steer clear these guys are rip off artist.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought for my grandson who is four and he can operate it like a champ\n",
      "Positive :-> No complaints from a functional tablet that does all you need for a great price!\n",
      "Positive :-> My old Kindle was 4 years old, this one is so much easier to use. I like the new features. I definitely will recommend it to my friends and family.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my fire stick movies , music, even movies that just came out are all free wow this is the best Valentines Gift ever and for all ages to enjoy so get yours today\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought it for my daughter. Works great Store personnel did an excellent job\n",
      "Positive :-> Any one who doesn't want to spend too much money and get a tablet for kids it is perfect for them.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Tablet for my grandson for Christmas. It was the best investment that I have made in all time. He is learning so much that he can't put it down. As a matter of fact, he sleeps this it just about every night.\n",
      "Neutral :-> Limited apps, screen not as easy to touch. Good for the price.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought this for my living room Tv works great. No issues what so ever.\n",
      "Positive :-> Got this to replace a Roku. Similar content but more features and a seems bit faster. Only knock is minor: could be a bit more customizable. But overall an excellent, sleek interface.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the amazon link\n",
      "Positive :-> Great little tablet, but I was disappointed it did not wake/sleep with productive cases.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's perfect, my granddaughter loves it!! She's catching on so fast and learning so much!! Easy for travel and on the go\n",
      "Positive :-> This Kindle is nice and my wife who is an avid reader likes the screen quality but truthfully does not like being \"pigeon-holed\" by Amazon for every book or story. Having to go through them for nearly everything greatly declines from the ease of use of the various functions. The need to find or put her existing library into Amazon in order to use it on the Kindle is ridiculous and annoying. Once again a another good product being sadly limited due to a monopoly.\n",
      "Positive :-> awesome gift and perfect for kids or older adults easy to use\n",
      "Positive :-> Purchased this for my child who's in his terrible 2s! As you can imagine he has thrown the tablet around but with the protective case the tablet has survived. Overall He's really enjoying it. It's a little slow and he can get impatient but it works a lot better than most tablets. It doesn't have the greatest camera but it's good enough for a toddler. Overall it's a very decent tablet for a child!\n",
      "Positive :-> would get another, works great, having fun with all the options\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids have owned the kindle fire for over 4 years. It was time for them to be more focused on reading and this is one of the best dreaded out there. Kids love the device and they can quickly borrow books from the city library.\n",
      "Positive :-> good item\n",
      "Positive :-> I am enjoying my Kindle Fire. This is my third Kindle, but my first Kindle Fire. I really like the portability and the fact that in addition to books, the internet , checking my emails, I can also use it as a camera.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love reading books this way. This is my 3rd Kindle. My first was the one with the keyboard, then I got a Kindle HD. I wanted to be able to read outdoors so I bought the Paperwhite. I love it.\n",
      "Positive :-> My vision is failing, but this is easy to read in any light. It fits nicely in my purse to take anywhere.\n",
      "Positive :-> nice product with low price.i will recomend to my friends.working good.\n",
      "Positive :-> After purchasing for myself and mother in the past, I felt it was reliable and friendly enough for my 11 year old. Easy to set up and has parental controls. She loves to use it for reading and games. It's fabulous and the price was excellent and my main deciding factor. You just can't beat $49.99. Thanks Best Buy.\n",
      "Positive :-> My kids love theirs. No problem out of this tablet.\n",
      "Positive :-> This was the perfect gift for my Neice and nephew I bought two\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price. I bought this when it is on sale for $69 + $40 for 128 GB SD card, you have a great tablet when plenty of space. I used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced . This tablet is a deal !!!\n",
      "Positive :-> After reading the reviews I was very skeptical. I mainly use Apple products, but with 5 kids and apple out of my price range this was perfect. I was able to get 4 tablets for the price of 1 Apple iPad. The kids love and they don't mind the commercial. I like that I can manage their fire tablet via my phone and I get emails for everything they download. This was perfect for them. And I would buy it again.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet has far exceeded my expectations. The price was way lower than most other tablets but it does everything I need and want.\n",
      "Positive :-> I have seriously enjoyed having Alexa. She makes it a breeze to reorder any supplies I may need for my home such as toilet paper or trash bags. I also love playing jeopardy with her and listening to music. She's also an awesome smart home hub and was so easy to sync with my hue lights and speakers. Definitely a purchase I'm glad I made.\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is great! There are so many uses for it. Love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Now I don't have to feel guilty bringing my Kindle to work,he can play his games and watch his videos.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great item to own in your home. So you can entertain friends, family, and yourself!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> So I love my electronics. I have an Ipad but when I saw this on sale I got myself one just to have since I am a prime member I figured I could use this too. The only thing I like about this is that you an expand the the storage. If the Ipad had that option it would be amazing. So since I then expanded the memory I can have more movies to watch offline. Camera is horrible, So I would say if you have a younger child, this may be decent but nothing compares to an ipad.\n",
      "Positive :-> This tablet is a great value. Tablets in this price range usually end up failing quickly, but this tablet has held up perfectly for almost a year now. The 8GB is somewhat small, but adding an SD card has helped with storage. The lack of Google Play is a nuisance as the app selection is more limited, but by adding Aptoide, I was able to access many of the apps that are available in the Play store, but not Amazon.\n",
      "Positive :-> Sound quality is amazing. I really like the ability to take this on the go. Downside. I wish I didn't have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up\n",
      "Positive :-> Overall - good quality for the cost. Ease of use; functionality is beneficial and allows for great entertainment.\n",
      "Positive :-> Other than the fact that the set up for an iPhone was extremely exhausting and frustrating, the device itself works great and is a lot of fun and helpful .\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon - Echo met my expectations for this product\n",
      "Positive :-> My daughter likes her new kindle. It's her second one! She was surprised we bought her another one. The first one lasted 4 years!\n",
      "Positive :-> a nice tablet for a very good price. It has everything other expensive tablets do.\n",
      "Positive :-> For my 11 yr old, serves it purpose which is playing games and listening to music\n",
      "Positive :-> Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around\n",
      "Positive :-> I have two of these and three Fire TV sticks. Both products are great. The customization, the store, availability of streaming services, access to Prime benefits, Alexa, the voice remote, these are all great things on both products. Having the ability to plug in external storage and Ethernet makes me a happy user. The additional processing power is noticeable in response time of the interface. I also have a variety of Apple TVs. I appreciate dev access to these devices but that is definitely a poweruser thing.\n",
      "Positive :-> I absolutely love my Kindle...especially this newer generation! Great product!\n",
      "Positive :-> The Amazon fire HD10 is one of the best deals on the market. I've had a IPad and would rather have the HD10! It's what-1/3 of the price of a IPad and just as good, if not better\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my Amazon FireTv Stick. Bought one for my whole family.\n",
      "Positive :-> I love Alexa. She is great for information and music. It also keeps the kids occupied.\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent product that does what it is built to do and that shows great movies. Purchase this product Roku and this is a much better product. Love that I can watch other streaming apps as well on this device.\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought a few of these over the holiday for my niece, nephews and step daughter. They love it. I especially love the parental locks and restrictions that can be put in place. Helps to minimize what the children have access to.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great streaming device, and at a fantastic price. Forget the fire-stick get the fire-tv\n",
      "Positive :-> I am truly enjoying my Echo. She does way more things than I thought she could do. I love being able to just ask her something and she finds it. Whether it is to play music, find a radio station, or put on the news or whether. My husband is not very savvy with technology, but I have found him using her as well. She is a great companion to have in the house. I am looking forward to learning more about what she can do.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you like reading, this is the thing to get, so much better than tablet for reading.\n",
      "Negative :-> Alexis doesn't always respond, could not connect to WIFI when I took it to Vegas\n",
      "Positive :-> I purchased the Kindle fire about three weeks ago and rarely pick up my iPad anymore. It is a great reading device with the flexibility of allowing you to access many other basic applications. I carry it with me practically all the time.\n",
      "Positive :-> My 8 yr old twin had a tablet previously and we have no idea where it's at. So this time around I didn't want to spend much but wanted her to be able to go to all her fav websites. So far I love it!\n",
      "Positive :-> Excellent for browsing and reading. Good price for great quality.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Tap to integrate with the Echo. It is ideal for my husbands office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact Alexa. The wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect!\n",
      "Positive :-> My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids.\n",
      "Positive :-> Amazon Fire tablet is one of a kind!! Very easy to use and adaptable to fit all needs!\n",
      "Positive :-> I was looking for the Amazon-Echo, for awhile and Best-Buy had a great price so I bought it,don't know why I Waited so long to buy it. Use it so much I bought a Amazon-Echo Dot for my wife's business, We like it a lot!!!! GREAT JOB BEST BUY!!!\n",
      "Positive :-> No idea as I haven't opened it up yet. I bought it for my non smart TV and as a potential replacement for Xfinity cable box. From the reviews, it should work fine for what I intend to do with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Nice tablet. I purchased this tablet for my mom as well as my daughter they both love this tablet. Good for general web surfing and loading books.\n",
      "Positive :-> Kindle Oasis is phenomenal... It is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when I travel, the book-like screen doesn't bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, I can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your Goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly. The color Merlot is beautiful and I've had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. Completely user friendly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Thought it couldn't get any better than my Fire Stick.. Turns out it can be faster!\n",
      "Positive :-> Have enjoyed using the touch screen to operate. The page light adjustment has been very useful, especially when reading in bed with my wife sleeping.\n",
      "Positive :-> This kindle has better resolution and contrast ratio.It is light and comfortable. I would recommend this device at deal price.\n",
      "Positive :-> So far I am enjoying it and adding other compatible devices with it makes it amazing.\n",
      "Positive :-> Great battery life and easy to navigate!!! Great value!\n",
      "Positive :-> We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great!\n",
      "Negative :-> When I first got it was great until it stopped charging and wouldn't turn back on\n",
      "Positive :-> Pretty good at understanding what you say. Can't do everything You would think or hope but, for The most part, gets the job done.\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to install and worked great - highly recommend\n",
      "Positive :-> I bought the Kindle White for my wife. She loves being able to read a book, without having to use wifi.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a gift for my niece but I use it every now and then. She loves it, gives her ebook, music, videos, games etc... All in one through Amazon without having to get any external apps, most already built in. I like it as well except not so much the platform and navigating around it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very satisfied with the small tablet. Larger than my phone so I can see things better when I play games and look up thing on the internet.\n",
      "Positive :-> I like my kindle and got it at great price.I would recommend it to someone and it's kid friendly as well so it's great to read books.\n",
      "Positive :-> The kindle fire is great especially the kid version. The free time app keeps the kids out of my files and prevents them from messing with tablet settings.\n",
      "Positive :-> I used a lot of different streaming boxes over the years I've never had a lot of success with them until now these Amazon boxes are extremely well built and provide excellent content\n",
      "Positive :-> I did my research before I bought this and there have been no surprises. I wanted a nice easy screen to read, and a good battery. The paperwhite has both. For the price it is hard to beat this device.\n",
      "Positive :-> I've cancelled my cable. Best purchase I've made in a long time. The picture quality is amazing.\n",
      "Positive :-> It is a nice tablet to have, however I do not like the setup for making a kid profile and not being able to download to their profile. Also do not like amazon's charge for a kid profile.\n",
      "Positive :-> If you're using an older Kindle Paperwhite model (like I was), the higher resolution and additional font choices available in this model more than justify the upgrade cost.I'd recommend the white case if you can get it. It's a lot easier to find the microUSB port when you're trying to plug in a, charging cable.\n",
      "Positive :-> Beach necessity for avid reader! It is a must have if you want to read in direct sunlight!\n",
      "Positive :-> This is the best of all kindles- affordable and easier to read. The backlight option is good to read in dark.\n",
      "Positive :-> Tablet was a Christmas gift, it is just right for the purposes mentioned\n",
      "Positive :-> I have a couple kindle fires myself. I loved them and she was looking for a reader. So I got her this kindle fire. She loves it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Simple and easy to operate. Upgrade from another kindle.\n",
      "Positive :-> Alexa doesn't know half of what my computer does. But the musical quality is good. It's a glorified radio. I think I would recommend the Dot. Save your money.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this for my dad. He absolutely loves it. It's easy to set up and very user friendly.\n",
      "Positive :-> It's good ... Just need to adjust .. Takes bit tine\n",
      "Positive :-> The Echo is a great addition to my home. It's convenient when we need specific information without logging on to the computer. I'm a Star Trek fan & being able to change the command to \"computer\" is priceless!\n",
      "Positive :-> I love my firestick. We choose not to do cable to save money in our first apartment and it has been great with the firestick.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is a great little tablet for under $50. It's good for surfing websites, social media, watching videos and checking emails. I prefer to use a laptop for more complex tasks. It came with Web Root which was easy to download for virus protection.\n",
      "Positive :-> I was looking for a tablet that I could carry in my purse. This Kindle Fire is perfect. I pair it with my hotspot and I'm online in a jiffy. Saves my phone data. I love it.\n",

      "Positive :-> the sound and pictures are great and easy to download apps.\n",
      "Positive :-> This product was extremely easy to set up and use. The whole family enjoys asking questions and the clarity of the speaker is great. We love the ability to link it to other smart products throughout the house.\n",
      "Positive :-> Awesome product. Lightweight and easy to carry. Love it\n",
      "Positive :-> Its a good Laptop by HP. Keep getting the same HP update message even after updates have been installed is worrisome\n",
      "Negative :-> I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit.\n",
      "Positive :-> He loves to read, play games and watch movies. Great purchase\n",
      "Positive :-> Easy to install and easy to use. I bought the white one, matches my floor, so it looks perfect. I love the sound quality and the many things Alexa can help you out all day. Weather, music, read books, the news, etc... I like to multi task and not having to stop something I'm doing to play a new song or find out what's the time in Barcelona is super helpful. I just use my voice to ask Alexa. Simple as that. I'm handling my cell phone much less and I love that.\n",
      "Positive :-> The black friday price was good for this tablet. Too many ads, but for what I use it for, it is great.\n",
      "Positive :-> Bought this as a gift--recipient was happy to receive it. After browsing prices online, I chose to purchase with Best Buy instead of Amazon because it was a better deal. The free two-day shipping was a nice bonus as well. A good experience all around; would definitely recommend.\n",
      "Positive :-> This echo is an addition to others we have in home. We are currently trying to get one out in every room. The sound quality is right there with any nose system\n",
      "Positive :-> Best Buy always offers great products at great prices. There sales are outstanding and I always find their sales persons to be knowledgeable and friendly.\n",
      "Positive :-> Speakers has an excellent quality, despite the small size.The only disadvantage is the Amazon Echo feature, not present in this one, which you can just \"call\" Alexa and she will answer you. In this one, as the name says, you need to \"tap\" the button to wake Alexa up.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love my kindle fire, takes awesome pictures and its convenient for on the go.\n",
      "Positive :-> Our daughter loves the size and portability of the product. Her iPad died and she uses her Mac book for school so this was a great choice for her to read books on.\n",
      "Positive :-> Recommended every day. Great Customer service also fast shipping.\n",
      "Positive :-> Love it. Very happy with purchase. Does everything I expected .\n",
      "Positive :-> Great product. The smart home integration is amazing.\n",
      "Positive :-> All is well. Haven't heard any complaints. Hopefully he will use it to help with his school work and not just play games with it.\n",
      "Positive :-> Very good value for the money. The kids love them! Easy to set up and use.\n",
      "Positive :-> Works flawlessly. Good contender to my brother's iPad. Much cheaper in price. Win for me.\n",
      "Positive :-> This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but it’s great for entertainment.\n",
      "Positive :-> These kindle tablets are beginning to get pretty cheap. Especially when the other kids tablets are relatively close in pricing. Nothing has gone wrong with this Kindle as of now, and our niece has been enjoying it. A kids account and adult account is made. The kids accounts has access to whatever the adults account allows. This is pretty standard in kids tablets, but this one handles it well. It makes it much easier.\n",
      "Positive :-> Good product.\n",
      "Positive :-> This just is so much fun to use. So easy to ask for music to be played. Quality is good too. We ask about our sports teams and ask for jokes. We just sit and laugh at how this works. We are just starting to use it for our shopping list. We used to use OneNote, but it is so easy to ask Alexa to add a product to the shopping list. She repeats it and has always gotten it right. You can also add it manually on the app. We love playing around with it and are learning new commands.\n"
